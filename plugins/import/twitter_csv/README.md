## Twitter Tweets CSV Plugin

This plugin checks for previous entries to avoid duplicating timelines.

### Notes
This import plugin has been tested against the old export CSV format from Twitter.  Currently Twitter provided the data as JSON - navigate to [Your Twitter Data page](https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data) when logged in to get your data and use the Twitter JSON import plugin.
