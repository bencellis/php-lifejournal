There they are, the memes, the statuses and the quotes; “Only the truth comes out my mouth”, “I tell it like it is”, “You can't handle the truth” and all that other mambo jumbo. Here is a truth, most of those people are lying. I'll tell you why. Have you ever wondered where the concept of the 'white' lie came from? The definition of the white lie is “a harmless or trivial lie, especially one told to avoid hurting someone's feelings” and in there, lies the crocks of the matter.... “to avoid hurting someone's feelings”. You don't even have to open you mouth to tell a white lie, an omission to tell is just as much guilty of the lie. Now you might say why? Well, we humans are social animals and are lives revolve (as much as we don't want it to) around relationships. The extent and the content of the social circle depends on you cultural background. In western cultures, the nuclear family and fiends form the social groups, in others, such as many African cultures, the extended family group forms the basis of your social network. These people are so important to you that they are the ones you are most likely to tell 'white lies' to. After all, what is the truth anyway? In many cases, in a social context especially, the truth is subjective. Truth and facts are not synonymous – facts can be proven but the truth? Let's have an example. Many people will say a baby is cute even when it is obvious that the baby is not. Hold on, who is it obvious to? To you, of course, but then “beauty is in the eye of the beholder”. Your concept of cute may be similar to the majority of your social circle but it is subjective. It would bear well to bear in mind when you want to tell the truth to consider whether in fact, it is true. If you don't believe me, go to two different news sites – preferably those with different view of the world – and determine if the new US president, Donald Trump, is doing a good job. This is why 'crime' detection based on oral statements is so difficult. The fact is that we are biologically inclined to protecting people in our closest social circle. Hurting their feelings especially for non trivial matters as 'does my bum look big in this' is not important enough to tell the truth. I mean in such a situation, if the person would be going out and embarrassing themselves, you might give them the semblance of the truth by maybe suggesting some thing a little less revealing. Consistently hurting people in your social circle is likely to mean you end up with no social circle at all and we know that instinctively. White lies aside, we cannot defend those who lie to cheat and manipulate others. Again our instinct to protect those in our social circle will force us to 'out' them. In this case, truth and fact may even be synonymous as many times you can prove the person is lying and expose their intentions. In this context, you perceived social circle might be as wide as the city you live in. Don't forget, social circles are fluid for example members of your tribe or citizens of your town are within your wider social circle. Facebook and Twitter and other social media is a fascinating place for people watching of a different kind. You see people bigging themselves up, lying to themselves and others, pretending to be what they are not including the 'tell it like it is' brigade and yet most of the people in their close social circle know exactly – subjectively obviously - how they are. If you find yourself on the receiving end of a hurtful 'truth' and the person telling you this does not care whether you are hurt or not, they don't consider you part of their circle and you should remove them from yours. If, on the other hand, you are one of those very few people who insist on 'telling the truth' even if it hurts those close to you, then you are an a***hole – and that is the truth.

♫♪♫♪♫ Bitter-sweet memories, that's all I have, and all I'm taking with me. Good-bye, oh, please don't cry, cause we both know that I'm not what you need and … I will always love you...♫♪♫♪♫ Recognise the lyrics of the Dolly Parton, made more even more famous by Whitney Houston and now sang by just about every wannabe songstress on talent shows the world over, song? If there is a contemporary song that goes against the thinking that 'love conquers all', it is this song. No matter how many inspiring 'love' quotes you can find, we all know that we could have destructive loving relationships and whilst I am concentrating on romantic love in this post, it is also true of other relationships. What makes romantic love different is that it is not driven by kinship, as in blood relations, but instead is driven by the biological need to create new kin, read children, and is triggered by no more than physical attraction, a feeling that sometimes could be as strong as lust. Scientists have spent countless hours trying to determine how this attraction works. The root cause appears to be evolutionary at a subconscious level and is can be environmentally and culturally affected. Well, my theory is that once this initial attraction stage is over, the 'dating' stage is next. This is where attraction translates, or not, into the initial ' infatuation' stage where there is more of a meeting of minds as well as the physical aspect. During this stage, logic should return and you should be able to discover if this is really the person you should be with based on what you need, your hopes and dreams, where whether this is the future parent of your children or the time when you discover if you should be running for the hills. If not, then the 'infatuation' slowly ebbs away and you slip into the 'mature' romantic stage. However, dating appears to have taken some kind of commitment element in this day and age and I see so many people somehow feeling compelled to hold on. This is where you should get to realise that love is just not enough. We are human beings and we tend to grow – how dare we? As we get older and hopefully wiser, our needs, hopes and dreams can and should change. In the case of mature romantic love, this can be problematic as there are two sets of needs, hopes and dreams that have to be catered for. This is where all the common advise of compromise in successful relationships comes from. But what happens when the compromise results into two very unhappy people? Unhappy relationships can also mean unhappy families – so more unhappy people! It is sad to discover at this stage that you are not what each other needs, so if you can, do it before you commit. In the old days, when a person's options were limited anyway, there were social and religious rules that allowed for couples to co-exist in relatively accepted roles. This is no longer the case in many Western societies and other societies are following suit. Additionally, both men and women have a much larger choice of options. If you are a family orientated person, then don't stay with someone who isn't and certainly do not start a family with them. If you dream of travelling the world before you settle into a career or family life, run away from a person who really wants to buy a farm and settle down straight away. If you have a need for someone to support you in your career choice, then don't settle with someone who will need the exact thing from you! If you think that 'love will find a way', you are in for a rude awakening. I will touch on the subject of love again in a future post but in the meantime, may you find the balance. Original Post:

Since I am now over the age of 50, I am now part of the army of grumpy old men and bear my responsibility to complain with all that great British fortitude. Several incidents in the last few weeks have left me feeling that I need to have have a word about British customer care, so don't scroll past. Customer Care - British Style. ======================= ... I know that dealing with the public can be trying at the best of times – see this post 'Nightmare Clients And Customers' (http://itsfeliciajuliana.com/nightmare-clients-customers/) about the matter but I digress. There are two areas where I feel there is a growing lack of customer care in British, or maybe I should say, English society – taxi drivers and pub staff. Of the two, the worst are taxis and I am kind of pleased Uber has made an appearance, it might wake some people up! For those outside the UK, we have two types of taxi services – well three with Uber if we separate them – the black cabs that operate similar to taxis all over the world and 'private hire' – ordinary cars which you should only phone the official number to hire. I have issues with both types so no difference - lot of these drivers think that they are doing their customers a favour! Two recent incidents are a point in case. Last week I had to remind my private hire driver that the reason I had called for a taxi to the tram station in Wolverhampton was not to be dropped of two streets up the road. He was trying it on because he was in a hurry to get to another job he had just accepted as soon as we had jumped into his car and he found out about our relatively short journey. He still had the audacity to be sarcastic after he finally dropped us of at the tram stop after negotiating the one way system that he got himself into. Another recent example was with a black cab driver. When I told a driver where we were going, I mentioned landmark that would help him determine which end of the street we wanted. When we got there he began pulling up and I asked him to carry a little further on and he nearly caught a fit! I had to advise him that since his meter was still on, I could at any time ask him to drive for another mile! I will now leave the taxi drivers alone except to say that the situation outside Coventry Railway station is a national disgrace. The black cab drivers behave like vultures when picking up passengers from late busy services. Someone is going to get hurt and they should – if they were trying to provide some descent customer care – organise themselves properly. Even a small station like Telford has this sussed. Now on to bar staff – including the market leading Wetherspoons, but first, the The Fox at ExCel , a pub serving attendees to shows at the ExCeL in London. Now I know that some pubs get very busy but you would think one that d_oes get busy, management will have found a way to 'manage' the situation especially since it is a regular occurrence. I mention this pub by name because I was really disappointed by the service I received and the general state of the place. International visitors attend shows at the ExCeL venue for chrissake, so at least keep tables clean! To cut a long story short because I could do a whole post on my experience really. Attempting to order fish and chips at the very busy bar for lunch, I was informed it was not available but I was not offered a menu to attempt to find an alternative. I just 'guessed' a burger was at least an option and order it from the same bar server who was having so much of a conversation with his colleagues that I had to call out for my receipt when he just walked away after taking payment. After waiting 30 minutes at a dirty table, I had to return to the bar to find out where my order which I was told was ready and would be brought out straight away. A little over 5 minutes later my food made an appearance with cutlery but no condiment basket – had to relieve another table of one. Now back to my biggest gripe at British pubs. When did it become the customer's responsibility to keep track of which one of us got the bar first? A well trained bar server keeps his eye on the bar and serves people in order. I might understand when the bar is three deep but not before! A well trained bar server does not leave his post while people are at the bar to go collect glasses, talk to serving staff or generally avoid serving. Weatherspoons staff are particularly good at these things especially in the bigger establishments. Then there is KFC!!! Or no, not that KFC in Bull Street, Birmingham? Yes, the very one, no more needs to be said. The point I would like to make to any of you who work in 'public' service. Provide the service, it is the customer that pays your wages – not the company you work for. No customers, no company, no job. Many of you would complain if you were at the end of bad customer care so if its too hot, too much trouble, get out the kitchen!

At the risk of jumping on the presidential inauguration issue and the current Obama nostalgia, here is a blog post I did on January 22nd, 2009 just after then President Obama's January 20th inauguration. I must have been on fire in January 2009 with my thoughts :) Obama's biggest burden. =================== Well, finally it is done. A non-white person now lives in the white house and expectations run very high. That is unfortunate for Obama because there is bound to be some big disappointments along the way. It's from these expectations that Obama's biggest task comes. Forget the financial crisis, forget the foreign policy that lies in tatters, forget the two wars in the Middle East and the domestic fights he faces, Obama's biggest task is to do a good enough job to ensure that it is not another 200 years before another non caucasian man takes on the job. It has just got to be good enough - no spin, no smoke and mirrors, a job done well enough for people to say, he gave it his best shot. The proof in the pudding will be whether he can be seriously be considered for a second term. If he does a good job, it won't matter if in a few years time there's a black George Bush in the white house, they won't be able to blame his colour! I do feel for Obama though, high expectations can lead to perceived failures! I have been fortunate in most of my life to be able to outdo expectation of me making me appear more successful than most. I hope Obama surpasses many of the expectations and hopefully he can do it with some 'black' finesse. For more on my take on expectations - see my blog post Great Expectations. Good luck sir.

Young people, do not be hoodwinked - banks are not your friends and here is a little something that I wrote in July 2010 on the matter... With many young people leaving the education system this summer and many not realising the pain that awaits them in the real world due to the new Government’s policies, it would be very irresponsible of us not to tell our young hopefuls some home truths. Hell, some of us, if we were lucky to escape relatively unharmed from the effects of the man-made recession, are still not sure what Government sponsored hardship holds for us in the very new future. Many of us don’t even realise that it’s not just others that are going to sweat but us too. What a lot of us know, though we would hate to admit it, is that the banks own our butts; the mortgage, the loan taken out for this year’s holiday and the recent graduate’s little run around and the gold and platinum cards proudly displayed in the wallet but used up to the hilt. Deep down we know that if the sh*t hits the fan, the collectors will be at the door. The ease of how you got into this position, the promises of how your interests are being take to heart, the sweet sound of our kindly financial institute assuring us they will be with us through thick and thin are likely to be distant memories. If you’re lucky, the apple of your eye may have had some money management lessons at school or college – but wait, wait a minute, usually it is banks that sponsor those programs. So all of us with fresh faced, ‘raring to go‘ younger people have to have the talk. Trust me if the ‘the bird and the bees’ talk was hard for you, this one will be more painful. How do you explain your financial predicament without the clever product of your loins looking at you like you are a total idiot? But it has to be said – no candy floss – rule number one when you step outside be more wary of the suited man with the briefcase of cash than the low jeans ganja smoker on the corner. “Banks are not your friends, my son.” Original and Links:

Lobby your supermarkets to use the 5p plastic carrier bag charge to support plastic bag recycling education and cleanup projects and actual recycling. Use hash tag #5p2recycle on Facebook and Twitter to share and show your support for the idea. Let's do this. Read on.... My local Tesco supermarket in their wisdom no longer provide plastic carrier bag recycling facilities. Facilities were removed 'since the 5 pence bag charge was introduced'. Following the example of many other countries, on 5th October 2015, England introduced 5 pence charges for single-use plastic carrier bags. Now maybe I should have taken more notice when the the charge was introduced but I assumed that the charge would go into 'plastic carrier bag' recycling facilities considering that only retailers with more than 250 employees are obliged to charge for bags. This leaves tens of thousands of shops – many in inner city areas – that still do not charge for carrier bags. Plastic Bag WasteInstead the Government 'requires' these chains to use the money collected for good causes selected by them. Really? No audit, no checks, nothing and then they choose the causes to support. Asda's published figures for Wales is here. Why was this not the opportunity to extend the collection of carrier bags especially local council provision? Not everyone goes regularly to the big supermarkets. Some residents of East Sussex appear to be able to recycle via recycling collection but it would appear that councils some like Powys who did collect at one stage did so withdrew the service. No other councils appear to have any policy and do not even provide facilities at recycling centers. Additionally, many people are unaware, as I was for many years, of what can be recycled with carrier bags since they are all made of 'plastic film'. Some money toward educating the public and obliging packaging companies to label those materials as recyclable would be also be a good use for our 5 pence worth. The introduction of restrictions such as out right bans and charges around the world are the result of the realisation of the polluting effect of used carrier bags. For many third world countries this is a serious issue – just watch any youtube video of poorer neighbourhoods and slums and see how many used bags are strewn around. They pose a serious risk to water life especially at sea and can take centuries to decompose and then only into non-natural substances. Yet, they are recyclable into many other useful products – youtube has countless examples. There is not doubt that the introduction of a charge has made a difference – the figures from Wales show that plastic bag usage dropped by around three-quarters after the introduction of a 5p charge in 2011. The fact is that there are still millions of bags being used and they require recycling - why are we not using the money to do just that? My dilemma of attempting to do the right thing is that I am stuck with a black bin liner packed with carrier bags that I need to get rid of. There is an estimated 40 bags littering up each household in England – that is a lot of bags that will end up in the bin. The big supermarkets will use their good causes to blow their own trumpets. Slowly I expect they will follow Tesco's lead and quietly drop collecting the very bags they charge for after all it is a cost that they could do without. Currently, unlike Tesco that apparently leaves it to the individual superstores to decide whether the plastic carrier bag recycling is to be provided, Sainsburys and Morrisons supermarket chains that appear to have a corporate policy, Asda does not appear to have any information on their website. Not everyone buys into the reasoning that this drop is bag use is making things better. See the Telegraph’s “Plastic bag charge: the unintended consequences of the 5p deterrent” for an some insight. Not sure we can get government to change quickly but I am sure that if customers pressurised their favourite supermarkets to not only provide recycling facilities but also to ensure that the good causes they 'choose' to support are those involved in the recycling education, cleanup projects and the actual recycling of plastic carrier bags and other film. Use hash tag #5p2recycle on Facebook and Twitter to share and show your support for the idea. Let's do this. Original Post and Links at :

Isn't funny that societies that historically measured the level of their 'civilisation' based on their artistic appreciation and artistic creation, that in this day and age most all types of artists in the developed world have to hold down day jobs to make ends meet? Only a small fraction actually make any real money. The picture is what my second eldest child and daughter bought me as my present for my 50th birthday. I'm not sure but I may have inspired her choice of present by discussing my writing and other artistic issues at some point. Writing is a thankless task. I spent the best part of a year penning the articles and blog posts on what was supposed to be the lead up to a new career and now my pet project previously 'Mixed in Different Shades' now 'Mixed Races' and despite PR and marketing spend, I am yet to make even a lousy £10. The other issue you have as an artist is that there is a danger that people who know you would mistakenly think you or even they, are the subject matter of your work. For example, if one of my daughters, a photographer, started taking nudes – particularly male nudes - what kind of feedback would she, or I for that matter, expect to get from grandmothers, uncles and aunties and others, never mind her partner's relatives? Admittedly sometimes your art is inspired by your reality but it is that 'sensitiveness' of people that make it difficult. Many in this internet age find refuge in anonymity (anonomosity?). I have been writing for as long as I can remember. Like many software developers (my day job) with tons of half finished programs, I have at least a half finished novel languishing in a cupboard somewhere in Zimbabwe, a few more elsewhere and a completed novel lost somewhere the dark recesses of my hard disk. There are countless short stories and half finished poems in drawers and in computer files on disk, story outlines and hastly scribbled film and stage scripts hide themselves in scanned digital files. I have even had a couple of poems published before and have had a lot of my poetry on the internet for all to read. On the other hand, I may not be a very good writer and so anything I write just will not translate into anything worthwhile in the end. It is the sense that it may all amount to very little apart from personal pleasure that makes it hard to motivate a person to spend too much time on their art. Original Posted at

Why would I care about a failing social benefit system, after all I am employed and do not claim? It is because it, like the NHS, touches me every day not only through people I know but by the increasing signs of poverty and hardship on our streets... Today some Austrians launch "Generation Grundeinkommen" - an initiative to implement 'Universal Basic Income'. Here is my introduction to the subject even if you live in other parts of the world.... **Universal Basic Income** This week's big new story is Oxfam's report on how the eight people own same wealth as half the world. Last year it was 62 people! The principle of 'Universal Basic Income' appears to be the idea that appears to be able to provide a workable solution against widespread poverty especially in countries where the 'extended family' support structures, important in poorer societies, have been eroded over the recent past generations. Handing over credit card Known by several other names such as unconditional basic income, citizen's income, basic income guarantee, the principle idea is that all citizens or residents regularly receive an unconditional sum of money as a form of social security. The mechanics of each scheme may be different, for example, negative tax rates, but the aim is that each person/family has enough income to maintain a minimum standard of living. With the rapid disappearance of many types of jobs many of which are never to return, a fact that US President-Elect Trump will have to deal with soon after his election promises, it is difficult to see evidence that these disappearing jobs are being replaced. Many of the new jobs do not require the sort of workforce numbers previously required and so unemployment is likely to increase to substantial levels in the future. With unemployment comes poverty especially in societies where family structures have been eroded by modern living. Growing poverty is a threat to society. It one of the most likely reasons for future social unrest – the kind that could blow up into another 'French Revolution' and is the reason why the idea continues to be considered. The Swiss became the first nation to formally contemplate the idea in a referendum on the 5th June, 2016 in which one of the issues was what was called Unconditional Base Income. The referendum included the issue following a Swiss Citizen's Initiative that gathered over 100,000 signatures. No payment amounts were suggested in the referendum, just the idea, and the vote was lost when only 23% of electorate approved. Prior to the Swiss referendum and since then there have been several experiments including one in Pakistan funded by the UK and the subject of a controversial news story in January after it was described as "exporting the dole" by a senior Tory MP. The Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) gives just over £10 a month to some of the poorest families in a country where millions live on less than £1 a day. The BISP scheme is not really 'Universal' and all the pilots or experiments have been more about Basic Income for the poorest in society. Around the world, several schemes have been run or are still running in places such as Namibia, Uganda, Brazil (2) and India. In the late 60s in the United States, there were several basic income-experiments all in the form of a negative income tax. On December 14, 2016 the Finnish Parliament passed the act authorizing an experiment of basic income beginning January 1, 2017. Like the Swiss, it would appear that some countries are not ready to consider Basic Income proposals yet, for example, the Dutch 'committee for citizens' initiatives decided against allowing Parliament to discuss the proposal on December 15th 2016. However initiatives are constantly being founded such as Austria's "Generation Grundeinkommen" touted to be launched on 19th January, 2017. An example of a working universal income scheme, though nowhere near the basic living standard paying only $2,072.00 in 2015, is the Alaska Permanent Fund which was created in 1976. The dividend pays a partial basic income to all its residents via the Permanent Fund Dividend [PFD] and is paid to nearly every Alaska residents that have lived within the state for a full calendar. If you have doubts about the growing 'poverty' problem, a quick search on youtube will reveal hundreds of videos showcasing the issue in both the US and in Britain. Links to further information on the Universal Basic Income are available on the original post at

Are the figures telling us the truth? UK data released this week apparently show wage inequality at its lowest since 1986 and is said to be highlighting the difference between perceptions that the wage gap between the richest and poorest is growing (see https://www.ft.com/content/394b82da-d74f-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e). Perceptions? According to the Office for National Statistics, unemployment is 4.8% (see https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment) but I personally know literally dozens of people out of work right now or have never held one. A case of Lies, damned lies, and statistics?

"That's it, I'm done, from now on I will look after number one, me and mine." You may have said this yourself or seen it on one or more of your 'dramatic' friend's Facebook timeline or twitter feed. I always shake my head when I see this because nearly all the time, that same thing will be said again by the same person at some point in the future again. The problem, it would seem, is that if you are a kind, helpful, giving person – you cannot help yourself – being selfish and heartless makes you uncomfortable and even unhappy. So why then these feelings of disappointment? Let me tell you a story. There was a children’s nursery that had a problem with several parents who were habitually late in picking up their children. Despite management's efforts, the situation did not appear to improve. Finally they decided that they would fine any parents collecting their children late and published this policy to all parents. All of a sudden they had a dramatic increase in parents collecting their children late. What happened? Well what happened was that the relationship between nursery and parents changed. From the parent's perspective, as long as they paid the fine, the nursery was happy with children being picked up late. This observation is the reason I advised someone close to me not to accept any money or favours for looking after her grandchild which allowed her daughter and her partner to work. If she did, it would then be an expectation from the child's parents that the grandmother was a child-minder rather than a grandmother and that brings potential for conflict. The moment you introduce some kind of agreement (contract) it changes the dynamics of the relationship. When you do a good deed, you need to determine whether you are doing a good deed or expecting pay back at some point in the further. Reciprocity (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)) - the practice of exchanging things with others for mutual benefit – is a feature of all social animals including us humans, despite Richard Dawkins' 'Selfish Gene' theory (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene). In some cases, the social rules of reciprocity are clear, for example, monkeys grooming each other but in other situations it is not so clear cut. Many of us in today's modern western world assume that everyone adheres to the 'nothing for nothing' rule and that some payback would be or should be assumed and expected. However, our modern western culture also promotes greed and selfishness so why would we expect that? If you are expecting payback, it may be better to make it clear. 'I owe you one' is a phrase that acknowledges the social debt on the behalf of the receiver who wishes to change the relationship from one of giving to one of reciprocity. However, in such a case, an additional complication is who sets the 'price' of the payback? Does lending you $20 when you desperate equate to you lending me $100 when I am desperate? In both cases, there is an expectation of getting the money back and being helped out of a jam. If there is a mismatch in each party's expectations, the potential for disappointment is increased. So if you doing someone a favour and you wish to get pay back, just say "you'll owe me one" and see whether the favour is still sought. Otherwise, accept that you have given and expect nothing. Judging from the number of times I have seen that time-line post, you will not be disappointed. http://www.benjyellis.net/blog/2017/01/expectations_and_disappointments.php

A little something for those of you who made New Year Resolutions from yours truly... *Resolutions resolved.* Many years ago, at least over 25 years ago, my mother who was a 60 a day smoker at the time decided to stop smoking on New Year's day. I had never known my Mum to make a resolution before nor I cannot remember her doing it since. Many people will discourage you from making resolutions by saying why wait for New Year's day to make a change that you should make at the time you decide you need the change. I would argue that there is something memorable about the date – the 1st of January - that makes it special. It is a open joke that most resolutions fail. Usually by the end of January, we are all back to our old habits, answering sheepishly to any enquiries about 'how the resolution is going'. This is true in many cases, I am guilty of it myself, but I have a theory. When I gave up my 20-30 a day smoking habit some years back, I gave up with two of my friends. Each of us picked a specific date to start and the method by which we would give up. One of us was mad enough to go cold -turkey. Two of us fell off the wagon, so to speak, soon after starting, myself included and one of us, me, fell off twice! However, we all gave up in the end, my last taste of nicotine – via a nicotine patch was funny enough - on the 31st December, 2006, some 4/5 months after I started. So what is my point? The point is that making a change is difficult and it takes next to superhuman will to stick to self imposed change – after all you are doing it to yourself and you can stop it at any time. You are most likely bound to fall over now and again. The trick is to get back again and keep going – even if you do take a few days break. For most of us having to continually admit that we have fallen is embarrassing and so we stop trying at the first fall and in there lies the reality of 'failed resolutions'. But here is the kicker that should motivate you to get back on the wagon this year, Sometime during the rest of the following year, you will have to revisit those same resolutions because you know you need to still make those changes. You will still know that you need to lose weight, stop smoking, reduce alcohol intake, get fitter, write the will or whatever it is. If you are stubborn enough not to do anything about it during the year, the same resolutions you make this New Year will the same ones you make next year. Might as well keep keeping on. So this year, don't give up even if you fail once or twice or even three times - so that next year's resolutions will be new ones and you will know that you have made some progress. As the great Jim Rohn said “Life expects us to make a reasonable amount of progress in a reasonable amount of time.“ Get to it then :) http://benjyellis.net/blog/2017/01/resolutions_resolved.php

"As the ONS admits, the survey has “inherent limitations” for measuring migration, not least because only a very small proportion of the people travelling to and from the UK qualify as “long-term international migrants” who are staying in the country for 12 months or more."

Good stuff! The Tories actually doing something of value and stopping the thieving estate agents from ridiculous charges - I have faced this several times and I always feel like I have been shafted afterwards. Rents will adjust according to demand not costs - so blah blah. For example, £150 for a credit check is ridiculous - you can do it over the internet!

It's been a really long time since I have been motivated to write a poem or even a short story but this morning.... *A 'Just a Regular Guy' Hero* There was something different about this funeral. The venue funeral venue was only half full unlike the packed church when they buried his wife some years back. It was no surprise, at least to his family, that his wife attracted a major gathering when she succumbed to the scourge of the modern life, cancer. She had been immensely though-out her life, she was involved in the school governing body, was part of the church support group and generally kept her friends close – even those she knew in school. He and his children suffered 'bravely' through her long illness and they bore her passing with great dignity. Unlike his wife, he was not a believer. He had very little time and had fairly strong views about religion and it was fitting that he was having a 'non-conformist' funeral. He was the type of guy you would think would want to be cremated but it would appear the family chose to bury him instead. Even the choice of music being played as I walked had no religious connections, a lovely Jazz track, music I had not even realised he loved. I noticed the difference about this funeral as I stood outside in the cold, pouring rain waiting for the venue doors to open. Just about every single person was genuinely upset and sad, lots had tears in the years with quite a few of them openly sobbing, a change to funerals I have attended before where the vast majority are sad but really turn up just to pay their respects. Eventually, we got to the 'final words' bit. Here I got to find out why so many people were that sad. So many stood up to say their little bit and I slowly came to realise what a hero this man was. Of course there were words from a couple of his children, he was their hero no doubt, a great loving understanding father who would do anything for his children. The special magic happened when his children's friends said their pieces, these grown-ups now came from broken homes, people whose parents were busy with the duties of life, who were children struggling with school and life and just how some very small acts meant so much to them. Then there speakers, many of who were his wife's friends, who spoke of all kinds of advise and help this man gave with marriage problems, issues with broken homes, dealing with troublesome children and even major financial upheavals. Many acts were small but they were acts that were of special importance to those for whom the act was directed. Then there was his best friend. He stood up and tried to speak, he wanted to say lots but he mumbled a little but finally gave up sobbing and being led back to his seat. Why was I here? Well I was a log standing work colleague. We had worked together for many years in some dingy government offices, doing some thankless tasks that many governments departments kind of need to do until he retired last year. He was like me, just a regular guy doing a regular job doing regular work colleague stuff like having long chats in the little office kitchen, having the occasional boozy lunchtimes, attending crazy office Christmas parties and sometimes being a little naughty and we were close enough to invite each other to some family occasions such as children's christenings and weddings and the like. Like I said, just a regular guy. As I sat there throughout the ceremony, I felt the emotion welling up and tears streamed down my eyes. I was sad for all these people who will miss him greatly, those who owe him a debt they will never be able to repay, sad that a man of his calibre had to die but really, really sad too, that I failed to recognise and befriend the special person this regular guy really was. – END –

See http://abcnews.go.com/US/no-winners-powerball-jackpot-wednesday/story?id=36132216 and http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35240597. Worth a punt?

Scientific research implies that it takes 21 days to make or break a habit - with 25 days done - with no cheating whatsoever - I have the will not to return to that daily habit and intend to drink only for social reasons. Having broken the smoking habit may years ago, what bad habit can I pick up now? Any person with an ounce of sense will know that men need a bad habit - answers on a postcard please? Oh, and get your hands in your pocket.

If you think about it, most people do things for charity that benefit them as well - marathons, climbing Kilimanjaro, sky dives etc etc. My sacrifice is any bit as good as those, don't you think? *hint, hint* :) https://www.gosober.org.uk/profile/benjaminellis﻿

Many of you who know me well, know how much I love the 'golden nectar' – so much so that over the last few years, I have rarely spent a day without having, at least, a few. In life, sometimes you get the opportunity to 'kill 2 birds with one stone' and this is one such occasion. Apart from giving my body a break, I will be supporting an organisation that, despite lack of resources, supported my kids and their mother, Isabella through her last days. Oh., I expect to be on the leader board... so give generously as the breweries will be having a tough month :)

The problem with contracting is that you still sell your time in return for your reward - usually cash. The difference is you get paid more because your customer/employer does not take on long term liabilities such as holiday pay, training and pensions etc. It is still earned, linear, income.

Today I turn the big 5-0. I thank all of you for your best wishes... Be warned though that there is at least another 20 years in these bones. I do realise how lucky I am to be here and now BUT that is no excuse to rest on my laurels. Many of you know I want to find my place in the sun - not only sand, sea and sun but also somewhere where I can give back, not to the places that shaped me, Zambia, Seychelles, Zimbabwe and the UK but anywhere as I am a child of this world. Here's to the next 20.

Happy Birthday Ben, hope you've had a good one so far. Will be see you at PM's soon?
Friday, 6 February 2015 at 06:54 UTC
If there was a child that was going to upstage my birthday, it would have only be Monique Songstress Ellis - born 1 day before my birthday, 23 years ago - bringing her mad sense of insight into this world and filling our hearts with joy and love. Happy Birthday, my ONLY second child and daughter, may you see many many more. I love you :)

If you find yourself in a situation where you have to tell your other half what a 'real man' or 'real woman' needs to do, YOU may have a problem. If you have had to say that in a number of previous relationships, then you definitely have a problem - YOU!!! Are you being real?

"Richard, watch that pedestrian." "You mean the one on the pavement?" Mrs Bucket ;) My Sat Nav ========== I have a little Satnav It sits thre in my car A Satnav is a driver's friend It tells you where you are I have a little Satnav I've had it all my life It's better than the normal ones My Satnav is my wife It gives me full instructions Especially how to drive "It's thirty miles an hour", it says "You're doing thirty five" It tells me when to stop and start And when to use the brake And tells me that it's never ever Safe to overtake It tells me when a light is red And when it goes to green It seems to know instinctively Just when to intervene It lists the vehicles just in front And all those to the rear And taking this into account It specifies my gear. I'm sure no other driver Has so helpful a device For when we leave and lock the car It still gives its advice It fills me up with counselling Each journey's pretty fraught So why don't I exchange it And get a quieter sort? Ah well, you see, it cleans the house, Makes sure I'm properly fed, It washes all my shirts and things And keeps me warm in bed! Despite all these advantages And my tendency to scoff, I only wish that now and then I could turn the bugger off.

EATING IN THE UK IN THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES Pasta was not known about. Curry was a surname. A takeaway was a mathematical problem. A pizza was something to do with a leaning tower. Bananas and oranges only appeared at Christmas time. All crisps were plain; the only choice we had was whether to put salt on or not. A Chinese chippy was a foreign carpenter. Rice was a milk pudding, and never, ever part of our dinner. A Big Mac was what we wore when it was raining. Brown bread was something only poor people ate. Oil was for lubricating, fat was for cooking Tea was made in a teapot using tea leaves and never green. Coffee was Camp, and came in a bottle. Cubed sugar was regarded as posh. Only Heinz made beans. Fish didn't have fingers in those days. Eating raw fish was called poverty, not sushi. None of us had ever heard of yoghurt. Healthy food consisted of anything edible. People who didn't peel potatoes were regarded as lazy. Indian restaurants were only found in India .. Cooking outside was called camping. Seaweed was not a recognised food. "Kebab" was not even a word never mind a food. Sugar enjoyed a good press in those days, and was regarded as being white gold. Prunes were medicinal. Surprisingly muesli was readily available, it was called cattle feed. Pineapples came in chunks in a tin; we had only ever seen a picture of a real one. Water came out of the tap, and if someone had suggested bottling it and charging more than petrol for it they would have become a laughing stock. The one thing that we never ever had on our table in the fifties …. was elbows!

We would like to thank all those who supported us yesterday by turning up for the Isabelle De Souza Ellis's funeral and those who with us in spirit. We were hoping to make a donation to the Compton Hall charity that so ably looked after her in her last days from the burial fund. However, the burial fund is in considerable deficit and donations are still being gladly accepted. Acct B C Ellis - Sort Code 07-44-56 Acct 49368422. For those who did not attend, Bella drew a considerable crowd and with the weather holding up for us went very smoothly. Thanks again to all of you.

IN 2002, cardiologist Carl Lavie began to see a confusing trend. The people he was treating for heart failure were living longer if they were obese or overweight than if they were thin. How could that be right? Obesity is notoriously bad for your heart and every other part of your body. -

Some people say ‘Why plan?’ After all, rarely do plans work out. That is true…. but without planning, skyscrapers would not be built – the fact that the plans had to be changed during its construction does not take away from the fact that it finally exists – a memento to human ingenuity. And so it must be for your life, plan for the future but do not be scared to adapt to changing and unforeseen circumstances.

Last night, half an hour before bed, I switched off the TV, the computers and the radio and sat alone in silence. I let my mind wander wherever it felt like; to the things I want to do, the things I could so, the things I would never do. I let it think of the people in my life, those still here and those who have moved on in one way and another finally resting on what I must do to realise what I want to achieve. Take time out, it's mindblowing. Today, I am on fire, watch out world! :)

"You cannot teach an unwilling student. Those who are ready to learn, will learn. Those who are not ready to learn, there is nothing you can do for them. Knowledge cannot be bought in the marketplace. There is no other way to learn something than to sit at the feet of the masters. This is what young folks are not always willing to do." - Wande Abimbola

Everyone has a right to strive to be happy but you cannot remain happy if you trod on the happiness of others in your quest. The happiest people are those who make other people happy and the really wealthy people are those who help others make a living. Think about it :) (PS banks take note)
Saturday, 17 November 2012 at 09:44 UTC
There is no such thing as a perfect relationship - especially after the honeymoon period - there's always something, always a niggle or 2 BUT there are good relationships, one of those is what you really want.
Saturday, 17 November 2012 at 09:40 UTC
No, no. Be yourself only if you are happy with who you are - if not, change, change, change. Change = Growth & Growth = Life. If you are not growing, you are dying.

Believing or knowing something to be true are 2 different things. Repeating what you do not know to be true is libel and you could be charged with ‘defamation of character’, ignorance is not a defence. Be careful. 1st Yellow card!

Things WILL change, nothing stays the same. You either wait until change is forced upon you and you then have little control or you make the changes and have much more control over how it turns out - good or bad. Many will advise you to wait, discourage you from change and if you do, it will EVENTUALLY be forced upon you!

I have a plan. The thing with me is I always have a plan. Something things go according to plan and many time they don't but when they don't I usually find myself in a better place then before. I do not have time to worry about whether others have a plan or what the plan is or whether they do not have a plan because I am too busy pursuing my plan, taking care of business :)

.We Won’t All Be Brown "...there are some things that are being said by mixed race people that make me uncomfortable to say the least. Things like ‘mixed women are the most beautiful’, ‘mixed kids are the cutest’ and the one I particularly ...dislike is the statement that we will all be ‘brown’ (used here as a proxy colour for all mixed race individuals) in the future. In my opinion, it is always dangerous to claim or give the impression of being better, prettier, nicer and cuter. It is from that sense of pride that injustices arise...."

Dead and Gone ============= How dare you lie there and smile, Up to the heavens, Knowing very well you've left me behind. How dare you lie there in silence, Without a comforting word, While I sit here and cry? How dare you feel so cold to to me, When you used to be so warm? Now all I feel is cold inside. How dare you die, Like some summer breeze, Knowing I lived only for you? (c) benjamin ellis - http://songsofwords.net/

HAPPY BIRTHDAY BENJAMIN! Our Gift to You Is A SMILE:-) A Smile Costs Nothing, but gives much. It enriches those who receive without making poorer those who give. It takes but a moment but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever. None is so rich and mighty that he/she can get along without it, and none is so poor that he/she cannot be made rich by it. A Smile creates happiness in the home, fosters goodwill in business, and is the countersign of friendship. A smile brings rest to the weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and it is nature's best antidote for trouble. Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away. Some people are too tired to give you a smile, Give them one of yours, as none needs a smile so much as he who has no more to give." CHEERS TO A NEW YEAR OF LIFE FULL OF THE HAPPINESS THAT YOUR SMILE WILL BRING! ONE LOVE!
Tuesday, 7 February 2012 at 11:18 UTC

Here's to me. ============ Stand up In good cheer, Lift those glasses high, Here's to me. Me, who has no money, Me, who has not much, To write about, Me, who listens, To the music of life. Me who thinks like a computer today And a painting the next, Is interested in biology, Then space, then I read A music piece for fun. Here's to me, A Jack of all trades, A master of none. Here's to me. The only one like me. (c) benjamin ellis - http://songsofwords.net/

Still Missing You ========== I know that lovers feel sad, I know that widows cry, I know widowers swallow hard and try To keep up with some pride, When a partner dies. And for many, years later, The pain still remains in their heart And memories that won't be filed away, But keep coming back again and again. But no-one had the strength to tell me, That the passing of a dear friend, Is maybe just as hard. Because after all these years, I'm still missing you, friend.

Africa ====== You haven't seen life until you have seen Africa, The blazing sun setting over the cool blue lakes, The raw passion of the bush and jungle, The total freedom of God's wild and free animals. No you haven't seen life. You haven't lived until you have felt Africa, The African sun beating down on your forehead, The heat that drenches your body with cool sweat. Hear the beat of the mysterious drums as the sun sets, And the people return from their work in the fields. You haven't lived until you have heard Africa, Seen the poverty and simpleness of life in the wild, Seen a people so humble, so believing and yet, So proud and cheerful, so full of song and goodwill That you definitely cannot find anywhere else. You cannot fight social injustice unless Africa Strums your heart strings and sets a tear to your eye, A people so misunderstood, a hardworking people, So down trodden and take advantage of by misguided leaders. No, you haven't lived life to the full unless you have lived Africa. (c) benjamin ellis - http://songsofwords.net/

A Dad's Horror ============== Two years and a grandchild ago, I walked up the aisle, And handed my lovely daughter, Dressed in white and covered in smiles, To what I thought was an upstanding man. Now I am horrified to find, That all that was a disguise And that you, Mister, beat your wife, And my grandchild now has that to spoil his life, Black Eyes and Bruises for your wife, Football, friends and plenty of booze for you And nothing but misery for your child. Mister, you may think you are hard, But you're nothing but a bully, To beat on your wife. Pull up your socks nad buck up your ideas, Or I'll have my daughter back, And I will take the child And you can got to hell. Oh, why didn't you tell me, my child, Oh why didn't you say For no matter what you thought I'd say, You are still my child. (c) Benjamin Ellis - http://songsofwords.net/

For God's sake, I am their father, But how can I be their dad, In the time you've allowed. Yes, the missus and I have our problems, She cried and told you her lies, And you didn't bother to hear my truth. Now you, your honour, have determined That my children cannot stay with me? What gives you the right to decide, The happiness of my children and of mine? Where's the justice, where's my right? Why do you think that I don't care, After all, they are also mine. How can you call yourself a judge? (c) Benjamin C Ellis -

A VERY SPECIAL SONG ==================== For every single lady I have loved, I've got a very special song, Each one remains as a pleasant memory, In the song I've dedicated to her. For every dreamy place I have been, I still sing a special song, To remind me that some places, I'll never see again, Except in my mind when I sing that song. For every beautiful moment I have spent, I live a special song, To keep me knowing those moments happen again, Whenever I hear the music of that song. For anyone, very special to me, I've made up a song, For my father, my sister and a special one, To sing when I think of my mother. But now, I have a song I really want to sing, And let everyone hear that special song, Made up to remind me, like in my life, You are the reason for that song.

Many people do not know this but I have been writing poetry, short stories and at least 4 unfinished novels since about the age of 9. My inspiration comes from life's events and emotions real and imaginary - just like those who write music. Writing words or music by its nature requires sharing and that's what I have been doing by sharing my poetry and if you like my stuff - feel free to browse at http://songsofwords.net - if any of my stuff touches you, wonderful, if not then just ignore it but don't make any assumptions about why I share any particular piece of work, its what feels good to me that day.

Walk All Over My Mind ===================== I'm letting you walk all over my mind, I'm letting you take a stroll through my head, For I'm missing your laughter and your smile And I need to see you again. I remember the time we had and shared, The sunrises, the sunsets and the land, The times we were happy and the times we were mad For you were my best friend. So once in a while, I put the world on hold, And let you walk all over my mind. © Benjamin Ellis - http://songsofwords.net/

Do You Think Of Me? =================== Whilst you wander on the great savannah, Of our great ancestor warriors, During this time when you're meeting, All those loved ones, who went before, Do you stop and think of me? Do you stop and remember, A friendship born of youth, Growing up in the following years? Do you ever think of me, your friend Ben? As you roam the spiritual hills, And join in the songs of old, Dance the warrior's dance, That modern living has hidden, Do you, son of Chief, ever think of me. I think of you nearly every day, Because you are in the work I do, You are in the songs I sing, You are in the way I feel. Yes, in this world of living The world you left behind, I still think of you. Oh yes, the meat on the 'braii' is still hot, The meat lacks the 'piri-piri' bite, The beer is icy cold, the way we like, But still it tastes so bland, The sun still beats down And I still carry on. And I can't help stopping and wondering, Every now and then, That in the great savannah in the sky, Do you ever stop and say to those around, "I have a friend called Ben"? © benjamin ellis - http://songsofwords.net/ Dedicated to the late Henry Mukudu - best friend a man could have.

I feel like I'm drowning, In a wave of sorrow, Felling like I am in the deep end, Of an Olympic size trouble pool. I'm swimming in trouble, Screaming for help in my despair, Asking why I am here, When really I should be there. I feel like the waves of life, Are paying around with little old me, Pushing and pulling me from side to side, Playing with my mind and body, In this massive sea of trouble. (c) benjamin ellis -

It was only relatively recently that 1 January became the first day of the year in Western culture. Upto 1751 in England and Wales (and all the British King's dominions) the new year started on 25 March. Today in worldwide use the Gregorian calendar's New Year falls on 1 January as was the case with the Roman calendar. The Islamic New Year occurs on 1 Muharram and occurs about 11 days earlier each year. There were two Muslim New Years falling in 2008. The Muslim calendar is based on 12 lunar months amounting to about 354 days. The Chinese New Year can fall anytime between 21 January and 21 February (inclusive) and occurs every year on the new moon of the first lunar month and the Vietnamese New Year is for MOST times the same day as the Chinese New Year. The Gujarati New Year is celebrated the day after the festival of Diwali which occurs in either October or November and depends on the Lunar calendar. Read more at

MAKES IT ALL WORTHWHILE ======================= Stumble out of bed, Fumble for a switch, In the middle of the night. Cries all around from a hungry child, A quick pick-up from the cot, Still very dreary eyed, Onto the breast, And there's some quiet at last. Then when she's fed and happy, Her little eyes light up, And her sweet little smile, Makes all worthwhile. Open up the nappy, And gasp in surprise. How can one so tiny, Create such a pile? The sweet smell of baby, Replaced by a sickening stench, But when he's clean again, His sweet little smile, Makes it all worthwhile. Carry a bucket of water, Find the soap and shampoo, Have everything close by, Baby is having a bath. Check the water and put her in, Let her splash and play a little, Then give her a wash. Its screams and shouts when its over, And you take her out. But once she's dressed and warm, You find it's all been worthwhile. (c) Benjamin Ellis - http://songsofwords.net/

COMES A TIME ============ Here is some advice that you can take or leave. But there will always come at time When a decision of some magnitude is required. You, and only you, can choose whether to stay or to go, Only you can make up your mind, Whether you can stand the pain Or whether avoidance is the way. You are still young, life stares you in the face, But its challenges remain hidden in the small print. And Just when you think you have it sussed, There comes a time when you have to face the truth, And decide to do the right The question will always who all and for why you do right, There will come a time but time will not wait for you.

YOU ARE FOR ME =============== Sometimes late in the night, In the shadow of my old memories, I see you and I get to think, How did I live before you, Before you made me smile. My life has never been so good, My love has never been so strong, As how I feel for you now. May my love for you never die, For my road would not be clear, If you had to go my dear. I wish I was a better man, For you really deserve better than me, But I do love you with all my heart, And if anything should tear us apart, Nothing could, my memories of you. Sometimes in the late of the night, I know, all I have even known is you. (c) Benjamin Ellis - http://songsofword.net

Come the New Year ============= Come the New Year And I'm going to change Stop the moaning and groaning And spend the year smiling. If things go wrong I will try the best I can To change them round and make it right. Whatever kicks I take I'll take them and laugh And on my merry way, I'll go Making things a little better In my little way. (c) Benjamin Ellis - http://songsofwords.net.

Christmas On My Mind ===================== I've got Christmas on my mind, The advertisers are already on the ball, Offering this nice thing and that. But what am I to do? I am a parent, a confused one too, But I've lost my job this year, No money to pay the bills, No money for this special rememberance, What am to say to the children? It seems like only yesterday, When the kids were all smiles As Christmas morning came along And there were presents under the tree. Then, this year looked more promising, Than the year that had just passed me by. What do I say or do, When your children show off their presents They've got from Santa Claus, And mine will have nothing to show? Do I say that Father Christmas passed us by, Because Daddy's been a naughty boy, And lost nearly everything because Big business are looking to increase profits, But cutting people on their payroll? God, how one can hate this time of year, When you've got nothing to give, And when you can't expect to recieve. I've got Christmas on my mind. © Benjamin Ellis - http://songsofwords.net/

IF I WERE SANTA CLAUS ===================== If I were Santa Claus, I'd start in Africa, And I 'd give them a rainy season And long lasting peace, every single year. If I were Santa Claus, I'd go to South America With my sleigh full of prosperity And give all the people some hope. If I were Santa Claus, I'd fly over Asia, And I would have no toys at all, But all my bags would carry is happiness. If I were Santa Claus All over the world I would go, Spreading love, peace and hope, Everlasting, everlasting, everlasting. Then my work as Santa Claus, Would be well done and I'll rest, And leave the world to learn, That is what Christmas is about. © Benjamin Ellis http://songsofwords.net

Since it is coming up to Xmas, here's another old poem. this one was liked so much by a school's Headteacher, it was read every Xmas for a few years in Xmas assembly. Enjoy! May This Christmas ================== May this Christmas be the one, When people open their eyes. Maybe,this Christmas will be special, As true love pours from our hearts. Will this Christmas be remembered in future, The year, when compassion reigned? The year the poor were overcome, By the generosity, the gift of happiness, Poured like wine and beer on Christmases before? The year when the warlords, Lay down their tools of destruction, Held their enemies in great hugs, And peace returned to the world? The year when the European Community, Destroyed no more food and sent it to Africa, To feed the starving millions, And gave them hope, on this special day? Maybe, this will be the year, When the people who have the power, To change many things for the better, Take into their hearts to do just that? Maybe, this will be the Christmas, When ordinary people like you and me, Say we are going to make our lives worthy, To provide a better future for the children of today? Will this, then, be that Christmas, That changes the world forever? ©Benjamin Ellis - http://songsofwords.net/

So many people, so many troubles, So much worse than mine. Food in the belly, Music in my soul, And work that I enjoy. And yet I want so much more, Better pay, bigger house, More music, more poetry, Why do we all want so much, I just wonder, just have to wonder Is happiness but an illusion?

I Have Outgrown You Now ------------------------------------ With all the water that's passed under the bridge, All the smiles, laughs and drunken talk, Somehow I knew that this time would come. I held onto you friendship to remember where I came from, Not to forget that thoughts and wants of all, But you refused to grow, Wanted to stay in your comfort zone. Now life calls me in another direction, And now I cannot grow whilst you hold on. So my friend, I have loved you, Probably more than you will ever know, I know as I fade into the distance, You may become bitter and sad, And question the sincerity of my camaraderie. But now I must really move on, Face the new challenges that wait for me, I've outgrown you, my friend, Have to leave you behind, But I will never, never forget what we had.

Latest Blog Post: “Whole villages wiped out, minor tribes completely erased, civilisations destroyed; millions of people died when the conquerors of the new world arrived with ‘old world’ diseases. However, the sailors, the explorers, the missionaries and later the colonialists also came in contact with diseases that they were too were not immune to. In here lies the history lesson that should warn us about the dangers. There are many serious diseases that have the potential to become widespread pandemics and our common humanity means that any fatal disease that develops and is transmitted has the potential to virtually wipe the whole human race of the planet.”

Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.

"Albinism is a disorder from birth caused by the absence or a defect in the enzyme that helps in the production of melanin that colours mainly the skin but also the eyes and hair. Many believe that albinism is much more prevalent in black people particularly Africans though in popular culture, the ‘evil albino’ such as Silas in the book ‘The Da Vinci Code’, is not usually portrayed as racially black. However being different can be very dangerous."

LATEST BLOG POST: Trying to decide whether Arabs are a distinct race raises the same questions we can ask for any other race. Looking too closely always leads to a blurring between of the lines and that is the point. Race is a social construct not a biological one. We cannot deny that race is still a large social concern and on that basis, do we need to classify Arabs as a separate race?...

You see the glass half empty. He sees it half full. You see problems. He sees opportunities. You feel out of control. He feels in control. You feel like a victim. He feels like a winner. You feel lost. He knows where he is going. You are heading down different paths. You can still ride with him but first you had better change your mindset. Follow him until you see what he sees, feel what he feels. Only then will you stand a chance, if any. Continue down your path, live in hope if you wish but not with him!

Doing a final clear out before my ‘pilgrimage’, I realise that since arriving in UK, I have been involved in 9 commercial ventures; the last one now funding venture number 10. 1 was profitable but unsustainable, most hurt my pocket and drained my time. I also have lots of poems, 2 unfinished novels making 4 in total, 1 draft screen play and many now useless computer programs. HERE IS TO VENTURE NUMBER 10.

"By far the most important lesson travel teaches you is that your time is all you really own in life. And the more you travel, the more you realize that your most extravagant possessions can’t match the satisfaction you get from finding new experiences, meeting new people, and learning new things about yourself. “Value” is a word we often hear in day-to-day life, but travel has a way of teaching us that value is not pegged to a cash amount, that the best experiences in life can be had for the price of showing up (be it to a festival in Rajasthan, a village in the Italian countryside, or a sunrise ten minutes from your home).
