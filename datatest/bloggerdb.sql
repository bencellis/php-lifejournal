You can specify either a recognised colour name\n  (eg. red, blue, yellow, etc.) or the hexadecimal\n  triplet alternative, eg. #FFFFFF, #000000. For example,\n  to create red text you could use:<br /><br /><b>[color=red]</b>Hello!<b>[/color]</b><br />\n  <br />or<br /><br /><b>[color=#FF0000]</b>Hello!<b>[/color]</b><br />\n  <br />will both output <span style="color:red">Hello!</span></li>\n  <li>Changing the text size is achieved in a similar way using\n  <b>[size=][/size]</b>. This tag is dependent on the\n  template you are using but the recommended format is a\n   numerical value representing the text size in pixels,\n   starting at 1 (so tiny you will not see it) through to 29\n   (very large). For example:<br /><br /><b>[size=9]</b>SMALL<b>[/size]</b><br />\n   <br />will generally be <span style="font-size:9px">SMALL</span><br />\n   <br />whereas:<br /><br /><b>[size=24]</b>HUGE!<b>[/size]</b><br />\n   <br />will be <span style="font-size:24px">HUGE!</span></li></ul><br />\n<a href="#Top" >Back to top</a></p>\n\n<p><a name="3"></a><b>Can I combine formatting tags?</b><br />\nYes, of course you can, for example to get someones attention you may write:\n<br /><br /><b>[size=18][color=red][b]</b>LOOK AT ME!<b>[/b][/color][/size]</b>\n<br /><br />this would output <span style="color:red;font-size:18px">\n<b>LOOK AT ME!</b></span><br /><br />We don''t\nrecommend you output lots of text that looks like this though!\nRemember it is up to you, the poster to ensure\ntags are closed correctly. For example the following is\nincorrect:<br /><br /><b>[b][u]</b>This is wrong<b>[/b][/u]</b><br />\n<a href="#Top" class="gensmall">Back to top</a></p>\n\n<h4>Outputting fixed-width text</h4>\n\n<p><a name="5"></a><b>Outputting code or fixed width data</b><br />\nIf you want to output a piece of code or in fact anything that requires a\nfixed width, eg. Courier type font you should enclose the text in\n<b>[code][/code]</b> tags, eg.<br />\n<br /><b>[code]</b>echo "This is some code";<b>[/code]</b>\n<br /><br />All formatting used within <b>[code][/code]</b>\ntags is retained when you later view it.<br />\n<a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>\n\n\n<h4>Generating lists</h4>\n<p><a name="6"></a><b>Creating an Un-ordered list</b><br />\nBBCode supports two types of lists, unordered and ordered. They are essentially the same as their HTML equivalents. An unordered list ouputs each item in your list sequentially one after the other indenting each with a bullet character. To create an unordered list you use <b>[list][/list]</b> and define each item within the list using <b>[*]</b>. For example to list your favorite colours you could use:<br /><br /><b>[list]</b><br /><b>[*]</b>Red<br /><b>[*]</b>Blue<br /><b>[*]</b>Yellow<br /><b>[/list]</b><br /><br />This would generate the following list:<ul><li>Red</li><li>Blue</li><li>Yellow</li></ul><br />\n<a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>\n\n<p><a name="7"></a><b>Creating an Ordered list</b><br />\nThe second type of list, an ordered list gives you control over what is output before each item. To create an ordered list you use <b>[list=1][/list]</b> to create a numbered list or alternatively <b>[list=a][/list]</b> for an alphabetical list. As with the unordered list items are specified using <b>[*]</b>. For example:<br /><br /><b>[list=1]</b><br /><b>[*]</b>Go to the shops<br /><b>[*]</b>Buy a new computer<br /><b>[*]</b>Swear at computer when it crashes<br /><b>[/list]</b><br /><br />will generate the following:<ol type="1"><li>Go to the shops</li><li>Buy a new computer</li><li>Swear at computer when it crashes</li></ol>Whereas for an alphabetical list you would use:<br /><br /><b>[list=a]</b><br /><b>[*]</b>The first possible answer<br /><b>[*]</b>The second possible answer<br /><b>[*]</b>The third possible answer<br /><b>[/list]</b><br /><br />giving<ol type="a"><li>The first possible answer</li><li>The second possible answer</li><li>The third possible answer</li></ol><br />\n<a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>\n\n<h4>Creating Links</h4>\n\n<p><a name="8"></a><b>Linking to another site</b>\nBBCode supports a number of ways of creating URIs, Uniform Resource Indicators better known as URLs.<ul><li>The first of these uses the <b>[url=][/url]</b> tag, whatever you type after the = sign will cause the contents of that tag to act as a URL. For example to link to phpBB.com you could use:<br /><br /><b>[url=http://www.phpbb.com/]</b>Visit phpBB!<b>[/url]</b><br /><br />This would generate the following link, <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/" target="_blank">Visit phpBB!</a> You will notice the link opens in a new window so the user can continue browsing the forums if they wish.</li><li>If you want the URL itself displayed as the link you can do this by simply using:<br /><br /><b>[url]</b>http://www.phpbb.com/<b>[/url]</b><br /><br />This would generate the following link, <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/" target="_blank">http://www.phpbb.com/</a></li><li>Additionally phpBB features something called <i>Magic Links</i>, this will turn any syntatically correct URL into a link without you needing to specify any tags or even the leading http://. For example typing www.phpbb.com into your message will automatically lead to <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/" target="_blank">www.phpbb.com</a> being output when you view the message.</li><li>The same thing applies equally to email addresses, you can either specify an address explicitly for example:<br /><br /><b>[email]</b>no.one@domain.adr<b>[/email]</b><br /><br />which will output <a href="emailto:no.one@domain.adr">no.one@domain.adr</a> or you can just type no.one@domain.adr into your message and it will be automatically converted when you view.</li></ul>As with all the BBCode tags you can wrap URLs around any of the other tags such as <b>[img][/img]</b> (see next entry), <b>[b][/b]</b>, etc. As with the formatting tags it is up to you to ensure the correct open and close order is following, for example:<br /><br /><b>[url=http://www.phpbb.com/][img]</b>http://www.phpbb.com/images/phplogo.gif<b>[/url][/img]</b><br /><br />is <u>not</u> correct which may lead to your post being deleted so take care.<br />\n<a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>\n\n<h4>Showing images in posts</h4>\n\n<p><a name="9"></a><b>Adding an image to a post</b><br />\nBBCode incorporates a tag for including images in your posts.\nTwo very important things to remember when using this tag are;\nmany users do not appreciate lots of images being shown in posts\n and secondly the image you display must already be available\n on the internet (it cannot exist only on your computer for example,\n unless you run a webserver!). There is currently no way of storing\n images locally with phpBB (all these issues are expected to\n be addressed in the next release of phpBB).\n To display an image you must surround the URL pointing to the\n image with <b>[img][/img]</b> tags. For example:<br /><br />\n <b>[img]</b>http://www.phpbb.com/images/phplogo.gif<b>[/img]</b>\n <br /><br />As noted in the URL section above you can wrap an image\n in a <b>[url][/url]</b> tag if you wish, eg.<br /><br />\n <b>[url=http://www.phpbb.com/][img]</b>http://www.phpbb.com/images/phplogo.gif<b>[/img][/url]</b>\n <br /><br />would generate:<br />\n <br /><a href="http://www.phpbb.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.phpbb.com/images/phplogo.gif" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />\n<a href="#Top" >Back to top</a></p>\n\n', 'André Rabold, Nathan Codding, The PHPBB group', 'GPL'),

This functionality was originally available as a plugin Widgets are now included by default in the core code, significantly cleaned up, and enabled for the default themes.</li>\n<li><strong>Full Atom support</strong>, including updating our Atom feeds to use the 1.0 standard spec and including an implementation of the Atom Publishing API to complement our XML-RPC interface.</li>\n<li>A <strong>new Blogger importer</strong> that is able to handle the latest version of Google&#8217;s Blogger product and seamlessly import posts and comments without any user interaction beyond entering your login.</li>\n<li><strong>Infinite comment stream</strong>, meaning that on your Edit Comments page when you delete or spam a comment using the AJAX links under each comment it will bring in another comment in the background so you always have 20 items on the page.

We don&#8217;t plan to continue to support the 2.1 branch, so this is a required upgrade.</p>\n<h3>Developer Features:</h3>\n<p>We also improved a great deal under the hood that hopefully you&#8217;ll never notice, but if you&#8217;re a developer for the WP platform it provides a lot to sink your teeth into. Here is a sampling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new set of WordPress-specific XML-RPC APIs that allow for editing pages, setting categories, and much more.</li>\n<li>We now use jQuery for a number of internal functions, and hope to transition all of our JS to use it. (We <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3824">still need volunteers</a> for this.)</li>\n<li>Comment feeds now support multiple formats, including Atom.</li>\n<li>Our internal mail functions now use phpMailer, which allows for things like SMTP support.</li>\n<li>You can now set database collation and character set in your config file.</li>\n<li>You can also hardcode your site and WP URL in the config file, overriding the values in the DB.</li>\n<li>Finally we&#8217;ve increased the inline documentation of a number of functions inside of WP, which should help you navigate those parts of the code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like an in-depth look at everything that changed, <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=2.2">here is a list of all 244 closed tickets</a> in our bug tracker and you can <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=tags%2F2.1.3&amp;old=5468&amp;new_path=tags%2F2.2&amp;new=5480">use this link</a> to see what files and lines of code changed. (It was a lot!)</p>\n<h3>New Development Cycle</h3>\n<p>Most interesting about this release is that is our first under the new, experimental development cycle that we <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/ella-21/">first talked about when we released version 2.1 fewer than 4 months ago</a>. We delayed a few weeks from our target date in April, but ended up under our original goal of a 4 month major release cycle. My thanks and congratulations to the entire WordPress community for pulling together and making that happen. It wasn&#8217;t without its bumps, but the things we learned along the way will make our next release in September even better. You can now look forward to a fast but stable schedule of new features and goodies several times a year from WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Around the Community</h3>\n<p>There were 1.4 million downloads of WordPress 2.1 in the four months it was available.</p>\n<p>I <a href="http://photomatt.net/2007/05/10/meaningful-overnight-relationship/">wrote a post that covers some of the media that WP has been getting lately</a> and its history.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve expanded WordPress.org quite a bit, most notably the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">very active plugins directory</a> and the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/">ideas forum</a>.</p>\n<p>Come meet other WordPress users and developers at <a href="http://wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a>, which is going to be taking place July 21-22 in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check out WordPress&#8217; cousins <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">MU</a> and <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>, both of which have been seeing some pretty cool development lately.</p>\n<h3>Help Out</h3>\n<p>The most valuable thing you can give back to WordPress is your time &#8212; the time to help a friend discover the joy of blogging, the time to help a stranger (a friend you haven&#8217;t met yet) on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forums</a>, or the time to help make WordPress a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress">better product</a>.</p>\n";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:59:"http://wordpress.org/development/2007/05/wordpress-22/feed/";}s:7:"summary";s:390:"On behalf of the entire WordPress team, I&#8217;m proud and excited to announce the immediate availability of version 2.2 &#8220;Getz&#8221; for download.

(We <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3824">still need volunteers</a> for this.)</li>\n<li>Comment feeds now support multiple formats, including Atom.</li>\n<li>Our internal mail functions now use phpMailer, which allows for things like SMTP support.</li>\n<li>You can now set database collation and character set in your config file.</li>\n<li>You can also hardcode your site and WP URL in the config file, overriding the values in the DB.</li>\n<li>Finally we&#8217;ve increased the inline documentation of a number of functions inside of WP, which should help you navigate those parts of the code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like an in-depth look at everything that changed, <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=2.2">here is a list of all 244 closed tickets</a> in our bug tracker and you can <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=tags%2F2.1.3&amp;old=5468&amp;new_path=tags%2F2.2&amp;new=5480">use this link</a> to see what files and lines of code changed. (It was a lot!)</p>\n<h3>New Development Cycle</h3>\n<p>Most interesting about this release is that is our first under the new, experimental development cycle that we <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/ella-21/">first talked about when we released version 2.1 fewer than 4 months ago</a>. We delayed a few weeks from our target date in April, but ended up under our original goal of a 4 month major release cycle. My thanks and congratulations to the entire WordPress community for pulling together and making that happen. It wasn&#8217;t without its bumps, but the things we learned along the way will make our next release in September even better. You can now look forward to a fast but stable schedule of new features and goodies several times a year from WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Around the Community</h3>\n<p>There were 1.4 million downloads of WordPress 2.1 in the four months it was available.</p>\n<p>I <a href="http://photomatt.net/2007/05/10/meaningful-overnight-relationship/">wrote a post that covers some of the media that WP has been getting lately</a> and its history.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve expanded WordPress.org quite a bit, most notably the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">very active plugins directory</a> and the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/">ideas forum</a>.</p>\n<p>Come meet other WordPress users and developers at <a href="http://wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a>, which is going to be taking place July 21-22 in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check out WordPress&#8217; cousins <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">MU</a> and <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>, both of which have been seeing some pretty cool development lately.</p>\n<h3>Help Out</h3>\n<p>The most valuable thing you can give back to WordPress is your time &#8212; the time to help a friend discover the joy of blogging, the time to help a stranger (a friend you haven&#8217;t met yet) on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forums</a>, or the time to help make WordPress a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress">better product</a>.</p>\n";}i:5;a:12:{s:5:"title";s:26:"WordPress 2.1.3 and 2.0.10";s:4:"link";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/development/2007/04/wordpress-213-and-2010/";s:8:"comments";s:73:"http://wordpress.org/development/2007/04/wordpress-213-and-2010/#comments";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 03 Apr 2007 07:50:45 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Matt";}s:8:"category";s:16:"ReleasesSecurity";s:4:"guid";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/development/2007/04/wordpress-213-and-2010/";s:11:"description";s:345:"We have a security update release now available for both the 2.1 and 2.0 branches of WordPress now available for immediate download.

A simple, yet effective technique, is to copy the code used for the admin panel to a separate file and simply provide an include in the function that loads the admin panel.</p>\n<p>For example, say you load in your admin panel using this code:</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>\n<pre>\nadd_options_page(''Plugin Name'', ''Plugin Name'', 10, basename(__FILE__), ''printAdminPage'');\n</pre>\n<p></code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The function <strong>printAdminPage</strong> is going to be the function that loads the admin panel.

For example, what if your plugin deletes or saves something?  You could include the delete code in its own file, and the save code in another file.</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>\n<pre>\nfunction save_or_delete($task) {\n	switch($task) {\n		case ''save'':\n			include ''includes/save.php'';\n			break;\n		case ''delete'':\n			include ''includes/delete.php'';\n			break;\n	}\n}\n</pre>\n<p></code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above code includes the appropriate code only when certain tasks are performed.</p>\n<h3>Load Parts of Your Plugin on Relevant Pages</h3>\n<p>With more plugins coming with their own stylesheets and JavaScript files, it may be necessary to specify which pages these files should be included.  Fortunately, WordPress has a nice collection of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags">conditional tags</a> and/or <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference">actions</a> that can help you determine what kind of page the end user is using.</p>\n<p>Say that you want to load a piece of JavaScript only when a user is in the admin panel.  Fortunately WordPress has an action specifically for loading scripts in the admin panel called <strong>admin_print_scripts</strong>.  A simple action call would look like:</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>\n<pre>\nadd_action(''admin_print_scripts'', ''addAdminJS'');\n</pre>\n<p></code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Within this &#8216;addAdminJS&#8217; function, I would run the <strong>wp_enqueue_script</strong> to include my JavaScript file.</p>\n<p>Another example would be only loading a JavaScript file on just single posts and nowhere else.  The action that is necessary to load JavaScript files is <strong>wp_print_scripts</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>\n<pre>\nadd_action(''wp_print_scripts'',''addJS'');\n</pre>\n<p></code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Within this &#8216;addJS&#8217; function referenced above, we could include a simple conditional tag to determine if we are on a single post.</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>\n<pre>\nfunction addJS() {\n	if (is_single()) {\n		//Do JavaScript code loading here\n	}\n}\n</pre>\n<p></code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now the JavaScript code will only load on a single post and nowhere else.

It was well done.</p>\n<p>Dennis Kennedy discussed the issues of copyright and the various rights and licenses you have for protecting your blog&#8217;s content, which includes words, images, and design. He also covered the issues surrounding GPL, General Public License, the license used by WordPress and most of the WordPress Community Themes and Plugins. </p>\n<p>If you need a refresher course, or are new to the subject of intellectual property rights, check out this great podcast. It&#8217;s worth the time.</p>\n<p>I do hope that they bring Dennis back for more as I&#8217;d like to see more answers to some of the questions they raised, and more on licensing WordPress Themes and Plugins under GPL and other options for a full understanding of what options these authors have to protect, or not, their code, and how to deal with changing a license on an existing WordPress Plugin or Theme that they change or take over and improve.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also like to see one whole episode that deals exclusively with the issue of responding to a copyright infringement. All bloggers, not just WordPress bloggers, are struggling with how to respond, and if and when they should respond, to someone taking their content and using it on their blog.

It was well done.</p>\n<p>Dennis Kennedy discussed the issues of copyright and the various rights and licenses you have for protecting your blog&#8217;s content, which includes words, images, and design. He also covered the issues surrounding GPL, General Public License, the license used by WordPress and most of the WordPress Community Themes and Plugins. </p>\n<p>If you need a refresher course, or are new to the subject of intellectual property rights, check out this great podcast. It&#8217;s worth the time.</p>\n<p>I do hope that they bring Dennis back for more as I&#8217;d like to see more answers to some of the questions they raised, and more on licensing WordPress Themes and Plugins under GPL and other options for a full understanding of what options these authors have to protect, or not, their code, and how to deal with changing a license on an existing WordPress Plugin or Theme that they change or take over and improve.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also like to see one whole episode that deals exclusively with the issue of responding to a copyright infringement. All bloggers, not just WordPress bloggers, are struggling with how to respond, and if and when they should respond, to someone taking their content and using it on their blog. All bloggers need to learn more about Fair Use, how it works and what&#8217;s acceptable as well as how to fight back against splogs and those who steal our content.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m wishing, I&#8217;d really love to have them talk to my copyright blogging hero, Jonathan Bailey of <a href="http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/" title="Plagiarism Today">Plagiarism Today</a> for his perspective on this issue.

My poisons are alcohol and tobacco.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat am I looking for?  I am looking for contentment.  Contentment, not happiness?  In my opinion, there are four facets to human happiness and these are the physical, the emotional, the mental and the spiritual.  I hesitate to use the word â€˜happinessâ€™ in my words because the word has been highjacked to convince us in various ways to buy, vote, think and other actions which will result in our happiness.  When you think happiness, what do you think of?  Contentment better describes the end goal of my journey.\r\n\r\nThe balance between these four aspects of the human being is what determines the overall well-being or contentment of the individual.  I suppose it is possible, to a certain extend, to compensate for a weakness in one of the facets.  In fact, nature does it for us sometimes as in the case of the better hearing of blind persons.  I do not believe that being more physical can solve a huge emotional problem.  What matters is the balance.\r\n\r\nAn imbalance is one aspect leads to imbalances in the other aspects of the human nature.  If you are unhealthy, then you are likely to be depressed (emotional) about it, which means that you may not be thinking (mental) properly.  The idea is where the balance is disturbed; you take steps to correct that problem.  I more inclined, at present, to believe that you have to balance the facet that is the cause of the problem.  For example, if you are spiritually void, it is the spiritual aspect that needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Physical:</strong>  Being basically healthy is good for you everyone knows that, I think.  Taking exercise, eating well and sleeping well are all good for you. The physical relates to you as a physical being, the stuff you can touch.\r\n\r\nYou might argue that mental and emotional states are the same as they are seen to be centered around the brain.  Furthermore, it could be argued that â€˜spitualismâ€™ is another aspect of emotion.  I beg to differ.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mental: </strong> The mental part of you relates to the way your brain works.  It is not about intelligence at all.  I mean who is more intelligent in the Kalahari desert, the San man (bushman) who can survive with very little or you?  The mental aspect is about making your brain work, about thinking about issues and trying to solve the daily grind of survival.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the  <strong>â€˜emotionalâ€™</strong> aspect is about feelings; love, hate and all the sentiments in-between.  The emotional aspect is the hardest one to control but the other three parts affect it more readily.  If you are healthy, spiritually stable and mentally agile, you are more likely to have better control over your feelings.  I would go so far as to say that being in a good mood would help any lovemaking you do.  Negative sentiments are usually the result of other deep seeded insecurities that the person has.  A jealous husband may think that the wife knows that shortcoming and is looking for something better.\r\n\r\nTo make this clear, I do not believe in God.  At least not what the churches have been preaching for centuries.  If you believe in God, congratulations, this aspect of your life is being looked after and I know many people who are comfortable with their â€˜religionâ€™.  Religion, however, is only a means of expressing spirituality.  <strong>Spirituality</strong> is about believing, knowing, having faith in something we cannot physically, mentally or emotionally prove to others or ourselves.  It is a way of regarding the meaning of life, the reason for our existence and provides the moral grounding on which we base our lives.  I am now of the opinion, that just having an opinion of â€˜lifeâ€™ is inadequate.  Just being â€˜atheistâ€™ can be spiritual. If you do not examine and practice this spiritually regularly, you are spiritually poor. \r\n\r\nMy journey here is to find the right balance for me here and it has to start with handling and dealing with those things that keep me from starting and continuing.\r\n\r\nLove and peace, may you find the balance.\r\n', 'About this blog', 0, '', 'static', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'about-this-blogpod', '', '', '2005-10-04 19:47:31', '2005-10-04 18:47:31', '', 0, 'http://www.mukudu.net/blog/?page_id=3', 1),

My wife is now becoming very aware of the issue.\n\nI am talking about alcohol here.  I fear alcohol more so because my father was an alcoholic.  A real one.  However, my father''s alcohol problems caught up with him a few years after my birth and he ended up in mental hospital for the next 21 years before he died and so he had no influence on my drinking habits.\n  \nI do not drink when it is not appropriate.  I rarely drink at lunchtime, I work my hours and I do my household chores like everyone else.  Basically, I am still functional.  But provide the opportunity, like after work or during the weekend, and that can of lager will make an appearance sooner or later and I know once I have one drink, then the game is on.  Even I know that is not a sign of healthy drinking.  \n\nIs it possible that my realisation is a sign that there not really a problem, after all, I am not under any major pressure to admit it?  If that is the case, then why is it bothering me?  Am I being melodramatic?  Maybe, but if one is not happy with one''s self, it must be a duty to change that what makes you unhappy but is that possible, I mean, can you change your character by sheer will power? Do I have the will power to change this because no matter how I look at it, I like drinking, I like the socialising.  Stopping drinking completely will change all that, my friends and family all drink as a social activity.  I will look and feel like a prat if I refuse to drink when everyone else is.  After all, I have noticed that holding a conversation with someone who''s had a few whilst dry usually is not a conversation!   The problems of the world have been solved in many of these get togethers.\n\nI have to find out if this situation I find myself in is a symptom of a deeper problem that I cannot identify yet.

I had my first drink at the age of 15 in the Seychelles but I do not remeber drinking again after that.  When we returned to Zimbabwe at age about 17, I started drinking more regularly, as my all my peers did.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhen I worked in a casino as a croupier after leaving school  in a Zimbabwean tourist resort that was totally boring out of season, I spent a lot of  time drinking with work mates and other off-season workers due to the unsociable hours we worked.  Hell, we even had serious drinking games!  My return to the capital did not change those habits.  Every man I knew enjoyed a jar or two or three.   Those late teen years were something else, the pubs and the nightclubs, the girls and the barbeques just had to enjoyed with beer.\r\n\r\nBeing an ambitious young man with a new family, I used my British citizenship to emigrate to the UK.  Emigrating is one of the hardest things I have done.  Assimilating to the new environment was very difficult but  without a social circle and the sheer lack of funds, drinking was occasional  and mostly controlled.    I came to learn computing but things did not work out as planned.  The family kept growing and things were hard for quite a few years.  \r\n\r\nThat has changed obviously and I suppose now that I am more comfortable,  was getting financial better off, have made friends and created a social circle that does now include more drinking.  This past year or so, my old drinking culture is returning with a vengence.  Up to this point, I do not believe I had an alcohol issue. \r\n\r\nSo what?  Well, I have found myself drinking more frequently (actually on a daily basis) and actually looking forward to it under the guise of socialising and once I get a taste then I find it difficult to stop until I have had a few.

The doctors have never told me how I got it but I suspect I could have been one of the first ''computer related'' DVT victims.  <!--more-->A few months later,  I saw a story in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2698119.stm">news</a>  about the condition.  That may not be entirely true though because I was doing a lot of physical work in the garden in the same period so it could have been that.  I was doing a lot of long hours in front of the computer as the company I was working for at the time had a lot of things going.  It put money in my pocket and beer in my hand!\r\n\r\nThe DVT treatment lasted one year and it was the scariest time of my life.  The thought that a tiny blood clot could kill me at any time meant I spent countless hours in the hospital whenever I thought there was a problem.  I remember crying (I mean tears here) so many times, I wrote letters to my family to be opened in case of my demise, I hinted to friends and family to look after my kids etc.   I believe that is why some of them think I am being melodramatic now. \r\n\r\nI was taking blood thinning tablets  throughout this period but someone made the mistake of telling me that alcohol also thins the blood.  The tablet phamplet did not mention alcohol as being detrimental and I was as sure as hell going to ensure that my blood stayed thin.  I went evey week to have it checked and many a time it was not as thin as it should have been!

I do, on quite a few occasions, have more than this especially where the drinking period is extended for example at parties.  What seems to be the factor that sort of stops me is tiredness.  My normal bedtime is between 10pm and midnight and once sleeps calls; drink is out of the window.  By this time, I am not normally blind drunk and many times feel fairly sober.  In fact, I canâ€™t think of a recent occasion where I was very drunk.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be one of the governing factor of whether I feel drunk or not is the pace at which I consume the alcohol.  My normal routine is that the first two drinks are consumed fairly rapidly, about a drink every 20-25 minutes.  Thereafter, it slows to about one every 35-45 minutes though I a number of times, I have averaged 1 an hour.  If I drink faster such as at parties then I tend to get drunk.\r\n\r\nWhen I do drink over an extended period, say over from a weekend afternoon to bedtime, my drink rate is much slower than normal and that is usually because I am doing other things at the same time.  On those occasions I normally donâ€™t get â€˜bladderedâ€™.\r\n\r\nAnother factor is food.  Eating before drinking is best followed by eating whilst drinking.  A lot of times though I eat after the drink.  What I do do is eat, whether I am drunk or not.  Rarely do I go to bed without food.  I also drink lots of water during the night.

You canâ€™t have any more that blah blah gums or use the inhalator more than etc etc.  The result, you are too bl**dy scared to overdose and so you actually end up craving tobacco.

Therefore, stopping smoking results in craving and withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine itself is not a major primary cause of smoking-related disease, but it has marked effects on arterial tone.

I understand that the term has been used for spammers posting comments to valid blogs but what I discovered is that there seems to be a few blogs that are constantly updated with the same material, most probably by some sort of automated system, which ensures they remain in the blog directories.  Nicotine therapies obviously are big business.  Is there no end to the lengths these people will go to gain eyeballs?\r\n\r\nAnyway, wading through the herbal remedies, replacement therapy and everything in between, I found out that Muslims during Ramadam give up not only food but the smokes as well.  I read an excellent <a href="http://bumming4inspiration.blogspot.com/2005/10/happy-meal-for-soul-mcmeaning-of-life.html">blog posting</a>  about this.  It got me thinking though that, maybe, there is a point to this.  Nothing can make you appreciate things a little bit more like abstention (absence makes the heart grow fonder). Of course, if I was one, I would take the opportunity give up smoking at this time but the fasting, I think, can must be good for the spirit. I suppose the most serious dieters would point out that your body would go into â€˜starvation modeâ€™ and store all available fat and water you eat outside the fasting period.  Christians are also supposed to give up something in Lent, though I suppose it is possible that originally, it was probably as strict as Ramadam.\r\n\r\nBut then this might be the point.  We have grown so accustomed to always having that out bodies do not have the chance to call on reserves and so we get fat and obese.  Far more important, I believe, is the spiritual thanksgiving (whether Muslim or Christian) that comes from doing without. Not being religious though, I think apart from appreciating these things we have, it also allows us to feel a connection to the millions that go without every day and not from choice.

I found myself between two warring factions and I ended up feeling like I needed asylum. <!--more-->Anyway peace returned in the evening over a few cans of beer, though they were both worse for wear when they came round.\r\n\r\nOur system here leaves too many people vulnerable to unscrupulous people.  Whereas you can expect that if the authorities donâ€™t know about a person, e.g. an illegal immigrant, very little can be done to protect them, those who are known to the system should have more done to protect them.  In some instances, asylum seekers can get some help for accommodation and living expenses but when you consider the sheer numbers, it is the authoritiesâ€™ interests if these people are afforded help by friends and family who have some right to be here.  Many asylum seekers also know that if you are be supported by the system, there are two problems, one is that there is a vested interest by the authorities to get rid of you and secondly that should your claim fail, you have the greatest chance of being removed.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the whole process can take months and months and add in any appeals etc and you could be looking at a year.  For a family assisting another this puts a major strain on any resources they have access to.  Some of these families are successful asylum seekers who, in most cases, have low paid jobs and are struggling to make ends meet.  The prospective asylum seekers are not allowed to work but are expected for example, to travel to an immigration office and â€˜sign onâ€™ in some cases, every week.  Where is this money to come from?\r\n\r\nIt is from these pressures that abuse becomes an issue.  The asylum seeker is now under pressure to find means of support and there are many unscrupulous employers ready to take them on.  Yet, there are industries in this country that are crying out for labour and even law abiding businesses can find themselves skirting with the law in order to continue surviving.  Everyone in these cases is being criminalized by this system.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the sheltering family takes advantage of this situation. Most of us have heard or read in the news a number of cases, where people have become virtually slaves.  Physical and mental abuse is not unheard of especially where children are concerned. \r\n\r\nWhilst you might argue that their situation here is better than what they are running from, it does not make it right!  We are a civilised and tolerant society that must face the fact no matter what we try and do, human nature will always result in people seeking shelter from those who would hurt them and we have a duty, as human beings, to afford them some help.

After all, after that I would be able to concentrate on sorting myself out.  Well it took until April to finalise the deal - all the time, maintaining my habits.  Now over a year later, I have full circle and realise that I have to do something.  So much has happened and I suspect I will talk about this missed period over the next few posts.   That is not to say that I have not been worried by the issues, it is just I keep putting it off until tomorrow and now, tomorrow has come.  Time to change is here.\r\n\r\nI have been here before, even before the time I set up the blog.  This really has to be the last time.  This is the time, the changes will be made and made permanent.  It is sad to think that at the springly age of forty two,  I am just as messed up as when I was twenty.  Oh yes, I have the house, the family and a reasonably well paid job but personally I feel unsatifisfied, uncontent.  I have to admit that change does not come easy for me, the change of job and work location (involving an extra two hours commute everyday) have not been followed by other changes that, maybe, I should have made at the time both externally and internally.\r\n\r\nBut change has to start somewhere, hence the revival of this blog and my <a href="http://songsofwords.mukudu.net/">poetry</a> site.  True the poetry is old but I have a stack of new stuff that I have to add.  I also intend to continue the <a href="http://ellisfamily.mukudu.net">genealogy and related stuff</a> I have been doing on and off for a couple of years.  The intention to do something more productive than drinking and smoking.  These sites are to be my spiritual healing, my praying and my emotional outlet.\r\n\r\nThere are other changes in the offing including moving house.\r\n\r\nBeing my first post in such a long time, this starts my commitment to spend a little time hopefully everyday to evaluate where I am going for the goal is noble - contentment.  My feeling about that has not changed since I wrote <a href="http://www.mukudu.net/talking2myself/index.php/about-this-blogpod/">this page</a>.\r\n\r\nLove and peace, may you find the balance.', 'Back Again', 0, 'One year and eight months later, I have come full circle again.', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'back-again', '', '', '2007-07-02 19:10:53', '2007-07-02 18:10:53', '', 0, 'http://www.mukudu.net/talking2myself/index.php/archives/55', 0),
