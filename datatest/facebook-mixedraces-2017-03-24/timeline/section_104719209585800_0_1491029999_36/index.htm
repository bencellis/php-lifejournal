All Basters can at least take pride in the trek.

The goals of the site are to:

Provide visitors with links to books, articles, dissertations, multimedia and any other resources to enable them to further their (and my) knowledge on the topic.
Remind visitors that so-called “racial mixing” has been occurring in the Americas for over five centuries and in fact, all of the founding nations of the Americas were mixed-race societies at their inception.
Ultimately support a vision of the irrelevance of race.

For example, the couple will need to face negative comments about them, even from supposed friends and family members. In some families, a son or daughter who is interdating may be warned about being cut off if the relationship continues. Some people who say they accept interracial dating may feel different when they see it happening to someone they know. There are still many places in the United States where an interracial couple will draw whispers, negative stares and jokes.`</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, 9 January 2017 at 22:59 UTC</div><div class="comment">Kristang: `What&#039;s In A Name?

At the time, Germany judged itself incapable of absorbing these “brown babies” — as they have come to call themselves. In the late 1940s and 1950s, efforts were made to match them with African-American military families, many of whom were stationed around Germany at the time.`</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 6 January 2017 at 10:59 UTC</div><div class="comment">Shirazi: `What&#039;s In A Name?

To the researchers’ surprise, they found that one individual in the study carried a very rare Y chromosome, called hgA1.

This particular variant has previously been identified in only 26 people worldwide, three African Americans and 23 men living in West African countries such as Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. “It’s so distinctive, it really sticks out like a sore thumb,” Jobling says of the chromosome’s unique sequence. He adds that it is virtually impossible for this sequence to have coincidentally evolved in Britain.

The white British subject with the hgA1 variant, however, knew of no African family connection.`</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, 5 January 2017 at 15:55 UTC</div><div class="comment">Maybe we should use DNA testing more?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, 5 January 2017 at 13:59 UTC</div><div class="comment">Red Bone: `What&#039;s In A Name?

The question tore through Heather Greenwood as she was about to check out at a store here one afternoon this summer. Her brown hands were pushing the shopping cart that held her babbling toddler, Noelle, all platinum curls, fair skin and ice-blue eyes.

The woman behind Mrs. Greenwood, who was white, asked once she realized, by the way they were talking, that they were mother and child. “It’s just not possible,” she charged indignantly. “You’re so...dark!”

It was not the first time someone had demanded an explanation from Mrs. Greenwood about her biological daughter, but it was among the more aggressive. Shaken almost to tears, she wanted to flee, to shield her little one from this kind of talk. But after quickly paying the cashier, she managed a reply. “How come?” she said. “Because that’s the way God made us.”`</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, 4 January 2017 at 04:59 UTC</div><div class="comment">New Zealand: `We know the Maori to be a mixed race, the result of a mingling of a Polynesian and a Melanesian strain.
