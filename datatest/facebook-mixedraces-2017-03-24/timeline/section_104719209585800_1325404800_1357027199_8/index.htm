A great article - reading it a thousand miles from ,home&#039;. I believe that we should not compromise our identity to fit into any given (recognized/institionalised) racial group - this simply perpetuates the pure race theory. Our heritage is a rich cultural background which we should applaud and not negate. It also gives us a multi faceted perspective. We belong to each other and that is good enough for me until we find a wider acceptance and recognition of who we are without having to reiterate our history every time we move beyond the limitations of our borders.&quot;</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, 22 April 2012 at 10:44 UTC+01</div><div class="comment">Only another 12 fans and MIDS will have 4,000 likes - please share with your friends and family - let&#039;s do this.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, 22 April 2012 at 10:40 UTC+01</div><div class="comment">Blaxicana gives you a look at how America is truely a melting pot.

A later survey in 1998 made that 143.  However 99% of Brazilians use the top 10 terms when describing a person’s ‘colour’ - branco, moreno, pardo, moreno-claro, preto, negro, amarela, mulata, clara, and morena-escura.  More fascinatingly, is that members of the same immediate family can acceptably be classified differently. (Brazil Snippet)

An example of the Brazilians use of ‘race’ as a social construct is what I like to call the chameleon effect.   One of its famous writers, Afonso Henriques de Lima Barreto, a mixed race slave descendant, was mulatto on his birth certificate, white on his medical papers at the height of his popularity and then when he died in 1922, a lonely, drunk in a psychiatric hospital aged 41, his death certificate stated he was mulatto.

============
Through my veins and my heart,
Runs the blood of an Englishman,
White in colour and with a long history
Of oppressing other cultures. 

My history has some black in it,
First a warrior, then a slave,
But very much still around,
Very much alive and fighting. 

The colour of my skin is honey brown,
Neither totally white nor black,
And yet not very different from either.
I am living proof for all to see,
That it is still very possible,
For white to love black and black white,
Combining two histories and cultures
Into one special one,
To create a world for all.

The Islamic New Year occurs on 1 Muharram and occurs about 11 days earlier each year.  There were two Muslim New Years falling in 2008. The Muslim calendar is based on 12 lunar months amounting to about 354 days.

The Chinese New Year can fall anytime between 21 January and 21 February (inclusive) and occurs every year on the new moon of the first lunar month and the Vietnamese New Year is for MOST times the same day as the Chinese New Year.

The Gujarati New Year is celebrated the day after the festival of Diwali which occurs in either October or November and depends on the Lunar calendar.
