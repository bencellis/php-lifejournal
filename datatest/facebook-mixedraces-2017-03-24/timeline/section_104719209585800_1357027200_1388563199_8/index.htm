I am still in need of more participants for my dissertation study. If you have one White and one Asian parent and would be willing to participate, please use the following link:

https://cgi.sfu.ca/~sisclab/cgi-bin/v5/rws5.cgi?FORM=MultiracialExperience2 

It would also be appreciated if you could forward this information on to anyone else who you know who might be interested in participating that has one White parent and one Asian parent. This type of research is difficult to do since there isn&#039;t a localized multiracial population, so any help with participation or recruitment would be amazing. Thanks for your time and consideration.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, 4 July 2013 at 10:12 UTC+01</div>Mixed In Different Shades shared Black girls are Beautiful ♥&#039;s photo.<div class="comment">via Jeanette Fay Cathro</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, 29 June 2013 at 08:26 UTC+01</div><div class="comment">Interesting photo story</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, 15 June 2013 at 11:58 UTC+01</div><div class="comment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Burmese</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, 17 April 2013 at 06:05 UTC+01</div><div class="comment">Hi!

I am conducting research as part of my dissertation at Simon Fraser University. As part of research being conducted on behalf of the Self in the Social Context Lab at Simon Fraser University, we are currently working on a study examining the experiences of multiracial people in today’s society. Psychology is just starting to study multiracial people more in depth, and we think it is important to understand more about the experiences of multiracial people and how they see themselves. 

We are specifically interested in people with one White and one Asian parent, as this population is the fastest growing of all of the multiracial combinations. Since multiracial people are found all across the globe, it is difficult to do this type of research without assistance with online recruiting. We would really appreciate your participation in this research. All participants will be entered into a lottery draw for $150 (CAN) for your participation. The anonymity and confidentiality of all participants are guaranteed. Any assistance you would be able to provide in facilitating this research would be greatly appreciated. If you are interested in being a part of this research, please use the following link to our survey :
