<p>The riots made me sad.  After so many years of living together, a small number of people decide to undo all that work with a few nights of violence that left one person dead.  <!--more-->I am sad because wherever I have been in Birmingham over the last few years, I see children of all colours and creeds playing in the parks and on the streets.  For me that has been a hope for the future as even I release that the multi-culturalism of this great nation is being held back by the older generations who hold prejudices that many of us keep to ourselves.  I have always been of the opinion that if you can be as racist as you want but leave it at the door when you leave home.  If all of us acted on our prejudices and pet hates, we certainly would be living in a sad and scary world. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The children are the future not only of this country but of the whole world and hatred and stupidity like this does note help.  How are these children supposed to act at school on Monday after the press reports and the violence?  I am very sad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can we really justify the damage done on the strength of what has yet to be proved?  Even if the rumours were true, do you blame a whole section of society for the actions of a few bad apples?  The only winners of the riots are the bigots that keep saying 'that multi-culturalism has not worked and that all immigrants should be deported'. I have seen working it working and let me tell you something; it is a beautiful thing to see. </p>
