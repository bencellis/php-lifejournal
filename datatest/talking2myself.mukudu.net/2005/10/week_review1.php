<p>Looking back at this week and I can see I have not done very well, have I?  I only managed two days without drinking and another day with limited intake.  I can't even think about giving up the cigarettes until I get a handle on the drink.<!--more--></p>
<p></p>
<p>Diet wise, I have not even started to contemplate any changes.  If I am to start a regime, I need to be prepared and the lack of funds just means I have to eat what I can get.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Exercise wise I managed two sessions of Pilates on Monday and Tuesday but the other days I felt so tired that 6am wake up was not an option.   My plan had been to get back into exercise mode with Pilates this week and then add Tai-bo next week.  Though I feel a bit disappointed with the effort this week, I have to remember that sleep is just as important.  I managed a few early nights but I struggled to get to sleep especially on the days I did not or had only a few beers.  My mind just keeps going riot and whatever I do I find myself still awake a few hours later.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I did mediate both on Monday and Tuesday before the exercise.  I am aiming for half an hour each day, early in the morning before the morning household rush.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mt timetable in the morning should be</p>
<p><ul></p>
<p>	<li>5.00 Wake up & have a cup of tea and a fag</li></p>
<p>	<li>5.30 Mediate</li></p>
<p>	<li>6.00 Start the morning rush by waking my eldest</li></p>
<p>	<li>6.01 An hour of exercise</li></p>
<p>	<li>7.00 Have a bath, shave and get my youngest ready for school</li></p>
<p>	<li>8.00 Breakfast for the kids</li></p>
<p>	<li>8.40 Drop the kids at school go to work.</li></p>
<p></ul></p>
<p></p>
<p>I need about 7 hours sleep, so working backwards, I should be in bed for 10pm.  I could get away with about half an hour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let's see how I do next week.</p>
