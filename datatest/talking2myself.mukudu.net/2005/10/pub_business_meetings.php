<p>When you want to discuss matters at work with work mates who live in different directions, the natural place, for me anyway, is the nearest watering hole.<!--more--></p>
<p></p>
<p>Things at work have been very stressful lately.  We need more resources, the customers are hard to find and a lot of changes are in the air.  How we cope with this I think is by discussing strategies and brain storming with a pint or two.  There just isn't the time to do this at work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The problem is though I might have or three pints, I get the taste and it is likely that I will drink a further two or three when I get home.  I cannot put my finger on it but I just can't seem to stop myself from getting those extra cans as I go in for my cigarettes.  I am trying to determine exactly how I feel when I want another drink, it's like being hungry but then again maybe I am hungry and that is acting like a prompt to get a drink.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I usually have something to eat around 9.30am, earlier just doesn't work for me  though I try when I was on the low carb diet.  It's just the hustle of cooking something in the morning that does my head in.  I have lunch around 2pm and so the longest time during the day when I do not eat is between lunch and dinner around 8pm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am not a snack person but I have considered having another meal around 5pm.  However, all the food shops around my work close after lunch and that adds to my daily costs.  (Notice how the beer money is not considered!).   Just another thing to consider.</p>
