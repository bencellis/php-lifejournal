<p>Recently, before I started this blog, I had a dream.  I was in a dirty pair of underwear with nothing else on and in public!  Desperately trying to find some clothes to put on.  People where pointing at me and some were laughing, some looking at me in disgust.  Everywhere I turned, no one could or would help me. <!--more--></p>
<p></p>
<p>I suppose I was a bit worried about 'hanging out my dirty laundry'.   It was also obvious I am scared of having to do it on my own.  This is going to be a personal battle, only I can change what is wrong.  However, I hope that there will be people on my side. I suppose there is always a danger that my real identity could be found and that could infringe on my life, particularly my work, but I will live with that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This blog has several purposes to me.  It is to be record to look back on like a diary.  I also hope it will help anyone out there dealing with the same issues.  If it helps just one person come to terms with their situation, helps them on their personal journey, then it will be well worth it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most important reason I have for ignoring my instinct of 'hanging out the dirty laundry', is that this blog will be part of my spiritual routine.  Just thinking about what I am doing, analysing the reasons for my actions and reinforcing where I am going on a daily basis I suppose is like praying or meditating.  It also gives me a chance to do some mental exercise considering what is happening in the world, forming an opinion and writing about it.  I intend to blog on a daily basis as much as I can.</p>
