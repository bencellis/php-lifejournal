<p>I seem to have lost control of my drinking in the recent past.  Trying to justify it, I am more inclined to think it happened when I got DVT.  The doctors have never told me how I got it but I suspect I could have been one of the first 'computer related' DVT victims.  <!--more-->A few months later,  I saw a story in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2698119.stm">news</a>  about the condition.  That may not be entirely true though because I was doing a lot of physical work in the garden in the same period so it could have been that.  I was doing a lot of long hours in front of the computer as the company I was working for at the time had a lot of things going.  It put money in my pocket and beer in my hand!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The DVT treatment lasted one year and it was the scariest time of my life.  The thought that a tiny blood clot could kill me at any time meant I spent countless hours in the hospital whenever I thought there was a problem.  I remember crying (I mean tears here) so many times, I wrote letters to my family to be opened in case of my demise, I hinted to friends and family to look after my kids etc.   I believe that is why some of them think I am being melodramatic now. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I was taking blood thinning tablets  throughout this period but someone made the mistake of telling me that alcohol also thins the blood.  The tablet phamplet did not mention alcohol as being detrimental and I was as sure as hell going to ensure that my blood stayed thin.  I went evey week to have it checked and many a time it was not as thin as it should have been!  The drinking kept me sane and kept my blood thin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, I felt that both the GP and the hospital were starting to see me as a pest.  I had to insist that they do a scan on both legs to confirm that my DVT had gone.  I had to, no-one could explain why I still occassionally, as I do now, still have these pains in my calf.  One thing I do know is that during that period and after I have never felt so unhealthy in my life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I just wonder could it be this period that pushed me to build a dependance on the warm glow of alcohol?</p>
