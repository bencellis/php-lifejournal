<p>Despite feeling a little worse for wear yesterday, I forced myself to do stuff around the house to tire my self out.  If I spent the day recovering from the Saturday night festivities, I knew I would struggle to fall asleep.  So I cleaned the whole house except for the rooms and the kitchen and tidied up some stuff in the garden. I think my sleep pattern has not reverted to norm since our annual 'friends and family' barbeque at the end of August.<!--more--></p>
<p></p>
<p>That did not help.  I did feel tired and worn out by 9.30 and was in bed for about 10, I then failed to get any sleep until past midnight. I used to have this system for sleep that worked very well in the past but is failing me miserably this time.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>I usually lie on my back, breathe in deeply threw my nose and breathe out through my mouth until my natural reaction is to breathe in again.  I do this a couple of times with my eyes closed.  Next, starting with my toes I try and relax the muscles all the way to my face, you know, ankles, calf, thigh, bum, groin, stomach, lower back, upper back, chest, shoulders, upper arms, lower arms, fingers, neck, neck, face and then the brain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I can't seem to concentrate enough before half way, I either have to go to the toilet or my mind has wandered off thinking of work, home or on some sort of daydream. I drink a lot of water when I go to bed, it is a habit I have had for years, maybe as far back as the Seychelles when the nights can be hot and humid.  The disadvantage is if I do not go to sleep quickly, I will make several trips to the toilet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have always thought what a waste of time, sleeping is.  I means, why can't the body repair itself and do it's housekeeping in an hour or two?  That way we get 22 hours a day.  I do recognise the need for a good night's sleep though, the feeling of being tired all day is just horrible. So there's another thing I have to work on in the next week or so. </p>
