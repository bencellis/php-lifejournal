<p>I became aware of my problem some months ago.  At first I kept it to myself and tries a number of times to change the this habit I seem to have picked up.  It has not worked.  I have since mentioned the problem to a number of people close to me but most of them have not really taken it seriously probably thinking I was being melodramatic. <!--more-->I think I know why, but that is a later post.  My wife is now becoming very aware of the issue.</p>
<p>I am talking about alcohol here.  I fear alcohol more so because my father was an alcoholic.  A real one.  However, my father's alcohol problems caught up with him a few years after my birth and he ended up in mental hospital for the next 21 years before he died and so he had no influence on my drinking habits.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>I do not drink when it is not appropriate.  I rarely drink at lunchtime, I work my hours and I do my household chores like everyone else.  Basically, I am still functional.  But provide the opportunity, like after work or during the weekend, and that can of lager will make an appearance sooner or later and I know once I have one drink, then the game is on.  Even I know that is not a sign of healthy drinking.  </p>
<p>Is it possible that my realisation is a sign that there not really a problem, after all, I am not under any major pressure to admit it?  If that is the case, then why is it bothering me?  Am I being melodramatic?  Maybe, but if one is not happy with one's self, it must be a duty to change that what makes you unhappy but is that possible, I mean, can you change your character by sheer will power? Do I have the will power to change this because no matter how I look at it, I like drinking, I like the socialising.  Stopping drinking completely will change all that, my friends and family all drink as a social activity.  I will look and feel like a prat if I refuse to drink when everyone else is.  After all, I have noticed that holding a conversation with someone who's had a few whilst dry usually is not a conversation!   The problems of the world have been solved in many of these get togethers.</p>
<p>I have to find out if this situation I find myself in is a symptom of a deeper problem that I cannot identify yet. </p>
