<p>A lady across the road once asked my wife how to get into fostering.  Apparently she thought that by sheer number of children that seemed to be in and out of our house, we were fostering.  But that is our house, not only do we have children of all sizes, shapes and races coming and going we have adults, African, West Indian, Asian, European and all sort of mixes doing the same.   Some people we see regularly, others only occasionally but ours is an open house.<!--more--></p>

<p>The guys at work have a nickname for my house;  The UNHCR (United Nations High Commission for Refugees).  Sometimes, when we want a break, my grandmother's words that have been echoed by many people since, is that our house is blessed.  I believe it is.  My children's friends, my wife's friends and my friends, family members all feel welcome in our 'not so tidy' abode.  We have never had to throw anyone out of our house. We have had heated debates and occasionally an argument but never have we had a fight!  Oh, yes, people have been banned where their behaviour warrants it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The disadvantage for me is obviously whether the call is social or someone looking for a shoulder to cry on is inevitably alcohol is part of the proceedings.  </p>

<p>This evening was one of those impromptu party days.  My wife's cousin came down from Scotland with a girlfriend and with the other visitors today, we had to light up the barbeque (I know summer's over but the weather was alright) to cook and we drank late into the night.  We had a sing along with the guitar and were introduced to some Scottish folk music.  Now, why should I give that up? </p>
