<p>After a single Guinness last night, I found it so difficult to sleep.  I read <a href="http://www.alertbutnotalarmed.com/text/on_the_wagon/">this blog </a></p>
<p>that made me jealous.  <!--more-->Unfortunately for me, a drink less evening does not necessarily turn into a perfect day.  I always seem to have lots of aches and pains the next day that I can't explain.  I'm not going to the doctor until I have something to really complain about.  I am tied of feeling like I am wasting their time every time I go there.  I promised myself that I would visit the doctor only when I feel so unwell; I feel I am going to die.  So much for a health service.  Come back to this subject some other time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sleep is the thing that is avoiding me.  My wife was not pleased with my sleeping pattern as I disturbed her tossing and turning nearly all night long.  It is funny just how things keep popping into your head when you are trying to sleep.  My old routine just does not seem to be working at all.  No sooner have I banished work from my mind, another thing pops in and it can be about just about anything.  Sometimes I even try to tire myself out by doing lots of things around the house.  It hardly works. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I have decided that I am going to research some sleep related stuff in the near future to see if I can detect a pattern. </p>
