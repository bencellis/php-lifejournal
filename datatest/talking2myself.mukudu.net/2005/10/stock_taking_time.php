<p>Last night I got drunk.  I went to watch the England match (well done England) at the pub, had three pints during the game and came home.  I got angry at something my wife did but did not speak to her about it and instead went and got an eight pack.  <!--more-->By the time I went to bed I was drunk and had upset two of my kids.  This morning, I dealt with the issue that made me angry, apologised to the kids and then sat them down and explained what is going on in my life.  I did tell them about the problems _ drink, money, work and our strained marriage.  We sometimes think that kids don't see what's going on but the usually know more then we think.</p>

<p>It is time to take stock now that I have tried over the past week to analyse the background to my problems.  I have always believed that striking a balance in life is probably the best way to achieve happiness.  The problem is that to break all the bad habits, ignore the stresses of life and concentrate on being content is a huge task and so we sometimes try to change one or two things but do make a concentrated effort to achieve balance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The task I am setting is a huge one, slowly but surely I am going to go for it.  I need to reduce the drinking and the smoking, eventually giving it all up, get more exercise and do so on a regular basis and eat better.   Most of all, take some time out every day for myself to meditate about me and the world around me, some of those thoughts will be recorded here in this blog.  Over the next week, I will start to put together a schedule and start to take steps to contentment. </p>
