<p>Last night, I had a hell of a dream.  I was in a posh hotel bar on my own and these two guys, important looking guys came in, pointed at me and said something to two other guys, hard looking ba***ds, sitting on one of the other tables who promptly stood up, got up swearing at me and threw a packet of cigarettes at me.  <!--more-->I got up in a huff and rushed towards these guys ready and looking for a fight (I am bl**dy nuts at this time) and the next thing I know, I am in a back room and crushing heads and arms in the door as they tried to come in.  Next thing, a kid, someone I know, has pulled a ceiling tile and called me up so I climb up there, I obviously have locked the door because I put the ceiling tile back and am rushing about looking for a safe way out of the ceiling as I can hear these thugs looking for me below and this kid is trying to tell me something and I am constantly telling him to shut up in a hushed voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyway, next thing I know, I've pulled up another ceiling tile and I have jumped into the hotel room of an old couple who get up shouting and screaming as I land on their bed and then, wait for it, I've torn a leg of a old oak or something like it table and guess what?  I go back in the bar holding the table leg and screaming right back at those thugs.  The look on their faces!  Then I woke up.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Now I am not a violent man, last time I had a fight I was in primary school.  I rarely get cross enough to even contemplate lifting my hands but in this dream, but in this dream, I am out of totally out of control.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I rarely remember dreams but this one is joining the list.   I have read dream interpretation books for ages, my mum is well into those, but I don't need a book to tell me what was on my mind. I have constantly telling myself that I have a fight on my hands and I want to beat it.  I have spent my life looking for ways out of the trouble I get myself into. Running away is my style and this dream means having to go back and deal with it.  Let's hope I can do it.</p>
