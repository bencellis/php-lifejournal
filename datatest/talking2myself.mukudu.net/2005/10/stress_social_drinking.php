<p>Had to work yesterday as the pressure is on.  It has been really for the nearly three years since my business partners and myself started our business.  We have just managed to keep our heads above water but the stress is telling.  <!--more-->If I consider how I used to enjoy my work before and how I feel about it now, I am not really surprised at how much I drink and smoke.  Replacing that release with something less harmful is where the trick lies I suppose.  Stress is one of the biggest excuses for having a drink, I know that.  You can't deny, that if you are a drinker, it works, I always feel relaxed after a few.  However, more than a few and depression at the situation can set in and I have had a few of those as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyway, popped in the pub on the way home promising myself a single beer but met a acquaintance from Zimbabwe I haven't seen for  while and once the football was on the box, it was four beers before I left. Got home to find visitors and another couple was on the cards.  Makes me think that even social drinking is something that is going to be difficult controlling.  All in all felt OK, didn't get depressed or anything.</p>
