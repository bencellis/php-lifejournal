<p>I started smoking at 15 or 16 when I was still at school.  Mum had always smoked though she hasn't smoked now in ten years.  She finally bit the bullet one New Year's day and hasn't touched one since then.  She wasn't the reason I smoked, I smoked because it was cool and I was grown up! <!--more-->Unfortunately, I started working soon after school and could afford my own.  I have previously tried to give up, it is the most expensive and 'waste of money' habit there is.  You can't even get high on the stuff!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Browsing the Internet I came across this site <a href="http://www.thecigarettecounter.com/">The Cigarette Counter</a>.  Now that's what I'm talking about!  It makes so much more sense than the stupid <a href="/talking2myself/index.php/archives/11">NRT</a> I wrote about recently.  We smokers need solutions that allow us to wean ourselves of the filthy habit.  I know this is a cop out but, face it, 'cold turkey' or NRT just does not work for the vast majority of us.  I think a rational way has a good a chance as any.  The body just doesn't like shock therapy!</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a problem though is that I have never seen one of these locally.  I do not want to email them, I can just imagine the damn junk mail that will follow, but I will come up with a plan to simulate this idea and I will try it.  Damn, I might use my card when I have some credit on it (Maxed out at the moment).  But first, I have to deal with the strongest smoking cue I have, drinking.</p>
