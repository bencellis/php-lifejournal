<p>Twice of note, I had limited success with giving up cigarettes.  Once I managed a week or so and the second time I gave up for over 3 weeks, a time when I had 'religion'.  I'll come back to the religion thing later but first, my gripe about 'nicotine replacement therapy'.  There have been other times where I have used the useless therapy, which proved just as expensive as buying fags. <!--more--> </p>
<p>What is the use if you cannot feel some benefit straight away?  Thank God, you can get in on the National Health, if you are willing or able to go to sessions during work time!  Imagine your boss' face when you say that you are off to your weekly 'stop smoking' clinic like you would for an appointment with the dentist.</p>
<p>This therapy is too restrictive.  You can't have any more that blah blah gums or use the inhalator more than etc etc.  The result, you are too bl**dy scared to overdose and so you actually end up craving tobacco.  When you do use this therapy, you do not satisfy the cravings completely.  Well I didn't.  If you smoke 30 to 40 fags a day, you are going to feel the craving!   This is one of the times when you know that some scientists are just out of touch!   Or, putting my suspicious hat on here, was it done so that the numerous world wide medical boards could approve the therapy?  </p>
<p>If I could replace cigarettes with something less risky and that very nearly satisfies the craving (just like smoking a slightly weaker cigarette) I could start to break the addition cues such as smoking after eating, first thing in the morning etc.  Thereafter, you can, my theory anyway, slowly reduce the level of nicotine intake at your own pace (a the hint for the scientists). In fact if you think about it, it would probably be more healthy to continue to suck on the inhalator for the rest of you life than to actually continue to smoke, how much worse can it be?  To quote the <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/">National Institute For Clinical Excellence</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><blockquote>'Inhaled nicotine is strongly addictive. Therefore, stopping smoking results in craving and withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine itself is not a major primary cause of smoking-related disease, but it has marked effects on arterial tone. The main disease-causing element from smoking comes from 'tar', a dark, viscous fluid formed from tobacco smoke, which contains at least 4,000 different chemicals, including over 50 known carcinogens and metabolic poisons.'</blockquote></p>
<p>I believe that the reason there is such a low success rate, 10% by some accounts, is that these issues are not considered when prescribing this therapy.  I think there is money to be made here and maybe help some of us poor souls.</p>
<p>There you go, one gripe of my chest for now.</p>
