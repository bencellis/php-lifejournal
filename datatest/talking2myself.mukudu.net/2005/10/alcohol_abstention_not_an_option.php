<p>Abstention?  All of us men need some bad habits and I can think of many other things worse than drinking and smoking.  <!--more-->I want to give up smoking completely; it's a complete waste of time and money. But drinking?  All of my social life revolves around drinking.  My close associates, friends and family all drink socially.  Some, I suspect, are in the same situation as I am but we strive on the influence to socialise. Normally I am a shy person but under the influence, we can talk about anything, politics, religion and any other thing that catches our fancy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I do know people who do not drink at all or drink moderately and let me say, most of them are BORING!  I remember the last time I gave up smoking and at the time, drinking wasn't an issue, I felt boring.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have this theory, of course, I have a few, that every male (women are from another planet, trust me) has a crutch or two or three, there are those who love cars, those whose football team wrings their pocket every week, those womanizers we all envy like hell and everything in-between.  Think about every man you know and each and every one of them has a habit of some sort that is detrimental to some aspect of his life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am not going to con myself that I will be completely deprive myself of the lager, it's just not going to happen.  I don't know why but there is something about being able to relate to other people like that!   Another I know is that I am a 'people watcher'.  I think it's got something to do with my artistic nature. I love watching people interact.  And there is no better place to see that but the pub where the defenses are a bit more relaxed. It inspires me to write.  Watch this space!</p>
