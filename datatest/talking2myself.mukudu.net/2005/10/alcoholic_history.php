<p>Thinking back, throughout  my life, I have been exposed to drinking.  Mum ran a guest house in the Seychelles for over six years and I saw a lot of alcohol abuse (other's) during those years.  I had my first drink at the age of 15 in the Seychelles but I do not remeber drinking again after that.  When we returned to Zimbabwe at age about 17, I started drinking more regularly, as my all my peers did.<!--more--></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I worked in a casino as a croupier after leaving school  in a Zimbabwean tourist resort that was totally boring out of season, I spent a lot of  time drinking with work mates and other off-season workers due to the unsociable hours we worked.  Hell, we even had serious drinking games!  My return to the capital did not change those habits.  Every man I knew enjoyed a jar or two or three.   Those late teen years were something else, the pubs and the nightclubs, the girls and the barbeques just had to enjoyed with beer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being an ambitious young man with a new family, I used my British citizenship to emigrate to the UK.  Emigrating is one of the hardest things I have done.  Assimilating to the new environment was very difficult but  without a social circle and the sheer lack of funds, drinking was occasional  and mostly controlled.    I came to learn computing but things did not work out as planned.  The family kept growing and things were hard for quite a few years.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>That has changed obviously and I suppose now that I am more comfortable,  was getting financial better off, have made friends and created a social circle that does now include more drinking.  This past year or so, my old drinking culture is returning with a vengence.  Up to this point, I do not believe I had an alcohol issue. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So what?  Well, I have found myself drinking more frequently (actually on a daily basis) and actually looking forward to it under the guise of socialising and once I get a taste then I find it difficult to stop until I have had a few.  I need to take time to analyse where it changed.</p>
