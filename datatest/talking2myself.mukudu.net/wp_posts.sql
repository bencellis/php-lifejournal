My poisons are alcohol and tobacco.</strong>\n\nWhat am I looking for?  I am looking for contentment.  Contentment, not happiness?  In my opinion, there are four facets to human happiness and these are the physical, the emotional, the mental and the spiritual.  I hesitate to use the word ''happiness'' in my words because the word has been highjacked to convince us in various ways to buy, vote, think and other actions which will result in our happiness.  When you think happiness, what do you think of?  Contentment better describes the end goal of my journey.\n\nThe balance between these four aspects of the human being is what determines the overall well-being or contentment of the individual.  I suppose it is possible, to a certain extend, to compensate for a weakness in one of the facets.  In fact, nature does it for us sometimes as in the case of the better hearing of blind persons.  I do not believe that being more physical can solve a huge emotional problem.  What matters is the balance.\n\nAn imbalance is one aspect leads to imbalances in the other aspects of the human nature.  If you are unhealthy, then you are likely to be depressed (emotional) about it, which means that you may not be thinking (mental) properly.  The idea is where the balance is disturbed; you take steps to correct that problem.  I more inclined, at present, to believe that you have to balance the facet that is the cause of the problem.  For example, if you are spiritually void, it is the spiritual aspect that needs to be addressed.\n\n<strong>Physical:</strong>  Being basically healthy is good for you everyone knows that, I think.  Taking exercise, eating well and sleeping well are all good for you. The physical relates to you as a physical being, the stuff you can touch.\n\nYou might argue that mental and emotional states are the same as they are seen to be centered around the brain.  Furthermore, it could be argued that ''spitualism'' is another aspect of emotion.  I beg to differ.\n\n<strong>Mental: </strong> The mental part of you relates to the way your brain works.  It is not about intelligence at all.  I mean who is more intelligent in the Kalahari desert, the San man (bushman) who can survive with very little or you?  The mental aspect is about making your brain work, about thinking about issues and trying to solve the daily grind of survival.\n\nOn the other hand, the  <strong>''emotional''</strong> aspect is about feelings; love, hate and all the sentiments in-between.  The emotional aspect is the hardest one to control but the other three parts affect it more readily.  If you are healthy, spiritually stable and mentally agile, you are more likely to have better control over your feelings.  I would go so far as to say that being in a good mood would help any lovemaking you do.  Negative sentiments are usually the result of other deep seeded insecurities that the person has.  A jealous husband may think that the wife knows that shortcoming and is looking for something better.\n\nTo make this clear, I do not believe in God.  At least not what the churches have been preaching for centuries.  If you believe in God, congratulations, this aspect of your life is being looked after and I know many people who are comfortable with their ''religion''.  Religion, however, is only a means of expressing spirituality.  <strong>Spirituality</strong> is about believing, knowing, having faith in something we cannot physically, mentally or emotionally prove to others or ourselves.  It is a way of regarding the meaning of life, the reason for our existence and provides the moral grounding on which we base our lives.  I am now of the opinion, that just having an opinion of ''life'' is inadequate.  Just being ''atheist'' can be spiritual. If you do not examine and practice this spiritually regularly, you are spiritually poor. \n\nMy journey here is to find the right balance for me here and it has to start with handling and dealing with those things that keep me from starting and continuing.\n\nLove and peace, may you find the balance.\n', 'About this blog', 0, '', 'static', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'about-this-blogpod', '', '', '2005-10-04 19:47:31', '2005-10-04 18:47:31', '', 0, 'http://www.mukudu.net/blog/?page_id=3', 1);

My wife is now becoming very aware of the issue.\n\nI am talking about alcohol here.  I fear alcohol more so because my father was an alcoholic.  A real one.  However, my father''s alcohol problems caught up with him a few years after my birth and he ended up in mental hospital for the next 21 years before he died and so he had no influence on my drinking habits.\n  \nI do not drink when it is not appropriate.  I rarely drink at lunchtime, I work my hours and I do my household chores like everyone else.  Basically, I am still functional.  But provide the opportunity, like after work or during the weekend, and that can of lager will make an appearance sooner or later and I know once I have one drink, then the game is on.  Even I know that is not a sign of healthy drinking.  \n\nIs it possible that my realisation is a sign that there not really a problem, after all, I am not under any major pressure to admit it?  If that is the case, then why is it bothering me?  Am I being melodramatic?  Maybe, but if one is not happy with one''s self, it must be a duty to change that what makes you unhappy but is that possible, I mean, can you change your character by sheer will power? Do I have the will power to change this because no matter how I look at it, I like drinking, I like the socialising.  Stopping drinking completely will change all that, my friends and family all drink as a social activity.  I will look and feel like a prat if I refuse to drink when everyone else is.  After all, I have noticed that holding a conversation with someone who''s had a few whilst dry usually is not a conversation!

When we returned to Zimbabwe at age about 17, I started drinking more regularly, as my all my peers did.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhen I worked in a casino as a croupier after leaving school  in a Zimbabwean tourist resort that was totally boring out of season, I spent a lot of  time drinking with work mates and other off-season workers due to the unsociable hours we worked.  Hell, we even had serious drinking games!  My return to the capital did not change those habits.  Every man I knew enjoyed a jar or two or three.   Those late teen years were something else, the pubs and the nightclubs, the girls and the barbeques just had to enjoyed with beer.\r\n\r\nBeing an ambitious young man with a new family, I used my British citizenship to emigrate to the UK.  Emigrating is one of the hardest things I have done.  Assimilating to the new environment was very difficult but  without a social circle and the sheer lack of funds, drinking was occasional  and mostly controlled.    I came to learn computing but things did not work out as planned.  The family kept growing and things were hard for quite a few years.  \r\n\r\nThat has changed obviously and I suppose now that I am more comfortable,  was getting financial better off, have made friends and created a social circle that does now include more drinking.  This past year or so, my old drinking culture is returning with a vengence.  Up to this point, I do not believe I had an alcohol issue. \r\n\r\nSo what?  Well, I have found myself drinking more frequently (actually on a daily basis) and actually looking forward to it under the guise of socialising and once I get a taste then I find it difficult to stop until I have had a few.

That may not be entirely true though because I was doing a lot of physical work in the garden in the same period so it could have been that.

The drinking kept me sane and kept my blood thin.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year, I felt that both the GP and the hospital were starting to see me as a pest.

A bit of winding from my colleagues and I set about to find a plan, maybe like the one I plan now.\r\n\r\nThen I caught chicken pox and did get it bad, even the GP drew her breath when she saw me.  Mum always said I have had chicken pox but she had said that about my brother who had it about two years earlier.  How would she have known anyway, both of us where stuck in some bush boarding school at the normal age when kids get it?  For four years or so, she only saw us at Christmas.  Lots of kids at school, I remember, had chicken pox and even German measles but I don''t remember having it.  I got chicken pox from my son, the last born, after my three elder children all had a bout.  Did I catch it because I was unhealthy at the time?

Meat, meat, fish, nuts, berries, fruit, vegetables and meat just made sense based on what I believe the human body has evolved to digest.  And water.  (Can you tell I love meat?)\r\n\r\nA few things put me off the Atkins diet and other low carb diets I discover in my research.  \r\n* counting of carbs _ I believe you should eat until satisfied.  If you eat the right food, should it matter? \r\n* supplements  - if you need supplements to complement your diet, then you are not eating well.\r\n* what have been described as ''pretend carbohydrates'' obviously gracefully supplied by Atkins Inc. If you need to pretend to eat chocolate or whatever, then you might as well join the ''functional addict'' club!\r\n* forcing your body to go onto fat eating mode, lipolysis and ketosis.  If you eat right, then, do you need to do this?\r\n \r\nBy far the most common sense low carb variation is one evangelised by a British man, David Mills with his carbWiser plan (<a href="http://www.low-carbdiet.co.uk/">http://www.carbwiser.com/</a>).  It is that plan with my variations that I followed for over the next 8 or so months.  My guiding principle with my diet was simple, if you cannot eat it raw or it''s just sweet for nothing, don''t eat it.\r\n\r\nI went from 98kgs in Sept 03 to at my lowest of 89kgs in Apr 04, some 9kgs in 7 months!  I also joined the brilliant forum at <a href="http://www.low-carbdiet.co.uk/">http://www.low-carbdiet.co.uk/</a>.   During this time I kept my exercise routine going and soon I put on some weight from muscle mass I expect.  I am now about 93 kgs but wearing size 36 trousers as opposed to 44 when I started.  Using clothes sizes is a better measure than weight because muscle is denser than fat.\r\n\r\nBut the devil drink had other ideas.  Beer always featured in my diet.

My normal routine is that the first two drinks are consumed fairly rapidly, about a drink every 20-25 minutes.  Thereafter, it slows to about one every 35-45 minutes though I a number of times, I have averaged 1 an hour.  If I drink faster such as at parties then I tend to get drunk.\r\n\r\nWhen I do drink over an extended period, say over from a weekend afternoon to bedtime, my drink rate is much slower than normal and that is usually because I am doing other things at the same time.

Thank God, you can get in on the National Health, if you are willing or able to go to sessions during work time!  Imagine your boss'' face when you say that you are off to your weekly ''stop smoking'' clinic like you would for an appointment with the dentist.\n\nThis therapy is too restrictive.  You can''t have any more that blah blah gums or use the inhalator more than etc etc.  The result, you are too bl**dy scared to overdose and so you actually end up craving tobacco.  When you do use this therapy, you do not satisfy the cravings completely.  Well I didn''t.  If you smoke 30 to 40 fags a day, you are going to feel the craving!   This is one of the times when you know that some scientists are just out of touch!   Or, putting my suspicious hat on here, was it done so that the numerous world wide medical boards could approve the therapy?  \n\nIf I could replace cigarettes with something less risky and that very nearly satisfies the craving (just like smoking a slightly weaker cigarette) I could start to break the addition cues such as smoking after eating, first thing in the morning etc.  Thereafter, you can, my theory anyway, slowly reduce the level of nicotine intake at your own pace (a the hint for the scientists). In fact if you think about it, it would probably be more healthy to continue to suck on the inhalator for the rest of you life than to actually continue to smoke, how much worse can it be?  To quote the <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/">National Institute For Clinical Excellence</a>\n \n<blockquote>''Inhaled nicotine is strongly addictive. Therefore, stopping smoking results in craving and withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine itself is not a major primary cause of smoking-related disease, but it has marked effects on arterial tone. The main disease-causing element from smoking comes from ''tar'', a dark, viscous fluid formed from tobacco smoke, which contains at least 4,000 different chemicals, including over 50 known carcinogens and metabolic poisons.''</blockquote>\nI believe that the reason there is such a low success rate, 10% by some accounts, is that these issues are not considered when prescribing this therapy.  I think there is money to be made here and maybe help some of us poor souls.\n\nThere you go, one gripe of my chest for now.', 'Useless Nicotine Replacement Therapy', 0, 'Twice of note, I had limited success with giving up cigarettes.

Unfortunately not one was solely about giving up the dreaded drug.  I''d love to find a humourous account of the harrowing experience.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nMy search via technorati introduced me to the ''spam blog''.  I understand that the term has been used for spammers posting comments to valid blogs but what I discovered is that there seems to be a few blogs that are constantly updated with the same material, most probably by some sort of automated system, which ensures they remain in the blog directories.  Nicotine therapies obviously are big business.  Is there no end to the lengths these people will go to gain eyeballs?\r\n\r\nAnyway, wading through the herbal remedies, replacement therapy and everything in between, I found out that Muslims during Ramadam give up not only food but the smokes as well.  I read an excellent <a href="http://bumming4inspiration.blogspot.com/2005/10/happy-meal-for-soul-mcmeaning-of-life.html">blog posting</a>  about this.  It got me thinking though that, maybe, there is a point to this.  Nothing can make you appreciate things a little bit more like abstention (absence makes the heart grow fonder). Of course, if I was one, I would take the opportunity give up smoking at this time but the fasting, I think, can must be good for the spirit. I suppose the most serious dieters would point out that your body would go into ''starvation mode'' and store all available fat and water you eat outside the fasting period.  Christians are also supposed to give up something in Lent, though I suppose it is possible that originally, it was probably as strict as Ramadam.\r\n\r\nBut then this might be the point.  We have grown so accustomed to always having that out bodies do not have the chance to call on reserves and so we get fat and obese.  Far more important, I believe, is the spiritual thanksgiving (whether Muslim or Christian) that comes from doing without. Not being religious though, I think apart from appreciating these things we have, it also allows us to feel a connection to the millions that go without every day and not from choice.  Maybe then, we would not change the channel on the TV when we hear another appeal for help!\r\n', 'Ramadam and Cleansing', 0, 'In my hunt for tobacco related blogs to link to, I was not surprised to find quite a few documenting attempts to stop smoking.

Whereas you can expect that if the authorities don''t know about a person, e.g. an illegal immigrant, very little can be done to protect them, those who are known to the system should have more done to protect them.  In some instances, asylum seekers can get some help for accommodation and living expenses but when you consider the sheer numbers, it is the authorities'' interests if these people are afforded help by friends and family who have some right to be here.  Many asylum seekers also know that if you are be supported by the system, there are two problems, one is that there is a vested interest by the authorities to get rid of you and secondly that should your claim fail, you have the greatest chance of being removed.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the whole process can take months and months and add in any appeals etc and you could be looking at a year.  For a family assisting another this puts a major strain on any resources they have access to.  Some of these families are successful asylum seekers who, in most cases, have low paid jobs and are struggling to make ends meet.  The prospective asylum seekers are not allowed to work but are expected for example, to travel to an immigration office and ''sign on'' in some cases, every week.  Where is this money to come from?\r\n\r\nIt is from these pressures that abuse becomes an issue.  The asylum seeker is now under pressure to find means of support and there are many unscrupulous employers ready to take them on.  Yet, there are industries in this country that are crying out for labour and even law abiding businesses can find themselves skirting with the law in order to continue surviving.  Everyone in these cases is being criminalized by this system.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the sheltering family takes advantage of this situation. Most of us have heard or read in the news a number of cases, where people have become virtually slaves.  Physical and mental abuse is not unheard of especially where children are concerned. \r\n\r\nWhilst you might argue that their situation here is better than what they are running from, it does not make it right!  We are a civilised and tolerant society that must face the fact no matter what we try and do, human nature will always result in people seeking shelter from those who would hurt them and we have a duty, as human beings, to afford them some help.  But leaving them in limbo with no means to ensure their safety and well-being is a recipe for disaster.
