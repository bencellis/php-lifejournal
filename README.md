# Life Journal

A PHP application to capture life events to be used as a base for an autobiography.

Not being in a position to leave my children much of an inheritance, I though might be an idea to write a biography as my legacy.  Obviously I need to track events and memories as they came to mind so I created this LAMP application to do so.  I run this locally on my laptop – with daily backups of the database so security is not a design consideration – I may change that later.

I have been blogging and writing for years so I developed some import plugins to capture historical data from Calendars (iCal), RSS (from blogging software), Facebook and Twitter data and failing that a simple CSV importer that would require the user to massage the data prior to use.  

I have just updated the import functionality to release the code and have just used it to update my data from the last time I imported date in 2017. There are READMEs in each of the import plugins folders.

I now use the application as a diary as well so I do input a near daily log of what is going on in my life currently.

I have not started to write the autobiography as I have another writing project going on at the moment with plans to complete the ‘Mixed In Different Shades’ (http://mixed-races.com) books after that.  Hopefully I will live long enough to get to the autobiography at some point.

Enjoy.

## Installation.

Just down load the code, create and update the includes/config.php file copied from the includes/config.dist.php and place the code in a top level directory on a web server.  Obviously PHP (min 5.6) will need to be installed on the server.
